We may not yet be able to properly imagine how it will affect our lives, but organizations need to start thinking about how AI can be applied to and improve everyday practice.\nWe can’t just leave this to the coding elite either. This program is therefore not about difficult algorithms and complex programming. Rather, it is for anyone, regardless of their professional background or job role, who is interested in learning how to prepare for and apply AI in their own situation, for instance:\n\nExperienced managers who want to know what AI can do for their own organization.\nData analysts or business consultants who want to understand how AI can be applied in the business processes of the company for which they work.\nStudents who want to understand how the results of AI research can be translated into practical applications.\n\nAI innovative solutions, such as the use of machine learning, deep learning, computational argumentation, diagnostic image analysis, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, robotics and data analytics, can help you and your company solve specific problems, drive efficiency and improve performance and decision-making.\nThis two-course program provides a wide range of cases and examples of current AI applications in various organizations. It presents ideas and case studies for actual situations based on state-of-the-art AI research, and provides practical tools for integrating AI into your own organization.\nThis program has been developed by Delft University of Technology and the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence Academy (ICAI) in the Netherlands. ICAI is a national initiative involving industry, universities and government in the area of AI research and applications. Case studies presented include contributions from top Dutch universities, public institutions and AI experts from companies such as ING, Ahold Delhaize, Elsevier, KPN and Thirona.",
