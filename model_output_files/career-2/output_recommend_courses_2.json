Before the rise of these technologies, predictions were made by methods like discerning cloud formations and wind directions. \nThis course will explore the science behind weather systems by teaching the observational skills needed to make a forecast without using instruments or computer models. We'll discuss the physical processes driving weather and the global forces that shape global climate systems. Finally, we will examine the limits of prediction in both human observations and computer models. \nCan the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?

Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050—the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections?\nJoin climate science expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\n\nDevelop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing;\nArticulate WHY the climate system is changing;\nUnderstand the nature of these changes;\nDevelop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.\n\nThe course covers the basic principles of atmospheric science, methods of climate data collection and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions. It introduces basic climate modeling and explores the impact of various greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Finally, it outlines the impacts of climate change on environmental, social, economic and human systems, from coral reefs and sea level rise to urban infrastructure. The course follows the general outline of the 5th Assessement Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",

What is the current rate of global sea level rise? How fast is the rain forest disappearing? Where do we find water on our planet? Should we worry about rising sea levels? Can we predict climate change? Our experts will give you first-hand insights on why, where, and how those techniques are used and they will show you how sensors work in space, on aircrafts, and on the ground.\nBy the end of this program, you will be able to assess and evaluate statements made in research reports and in media.

The course will give you the scientific knowledge and tools needed to understand the crisis, including the many uncertainties behind the science. What do we really know with great certainty, and what is less certain? Can we still act given the uncertainty in the science behind the  climate crisis?\nAfter a short introduction to global warming, we will go back in time and put the present changes occurring today in context, by looking back in time to the ice ages that have occurred on our planet over the past million years.\nAre the changes happening today really that unusual? Have similar changes occurred in the past? We will then focus our weekly discussions on key aspects of the climate system to better understand the complexity of our climate. We will take a journey to our Sun, the source of all our energy in the climate system. Can the changes in our Sun explain the recent global warming?  We will discuss the Energy Balance of our planet resulting from the balance between the energy we get from the Sun, and the energy lost from the Earth by cooling. We will learn about the water cycle and the important role of clouds and rain in the climate system. How do clouds impact the Earth’s temperature?  We will discuss atmospheric circulation patterns, winds and storms.\nThen we will dive down into the oceans that cover 70% of the planet to understand how the oceans impact our climate. We will visit the frozen parts of the Earth (the cryosphere), and the vegetated parts of our planet (the biosphere). How does the cryosphere impact sea level rise in the future?  How does the biosphere impact carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? We will take a trip to a volcano to understand how large volcanic eruptions can also impact the Earth’s temperature. Could we produce an artificial volcano to offset global warming?\nAfter studying all the different important components of the climate system, we will learn how computer models put all this information together to estimate what may happen to our global and regional climates in 2050 or 2100.  What are the various scenarios for the future? How accurate are these forecasts? And towards the end of the course, we will talk about what can be done to deal with the climate crisis. It is not all bad news. There are some very exciting solutions out there.",
