Product managers need to know and appreciate product designer tools and processes. By combining these principles with good scrum processes, you’ll learn to create great products that don’t sacrifice design for functionality or feasibility.\nThis course enables students to transition from ideas to prototyping and concept testing of their products and services. Students learn how best to effectively translate ideas into marketable offerings so that the best product and service ideas are harnessed and create real value for customers and the organization. Emphasis is placed on an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to engineering design, concurrent engineering, design for manufacturing, industrial design, and the business of new product development. Topics include design methods, modeling and simulation, material and manufacturing process selection, platform and modular design, mass customization, planning and scheduling.",

To best support their populations, designing tech solutions to problems must be more than functional. They must be more than usable. Solutions must be designed to maximize the totality of the experience that a person has with the designed solution.\nIn this program you will learn concepts, tools, and techniques, needed to design and develop information system solutions that will maximize the experience of those who will use your solutions, enabling you to work in a myriad of real-world roles that require designing IT solutions for clients. Program coverage includes important information to better understand how humans perceive, understand, and function in the world. In addition, this program will introduce you to techniques and tools to show you how to effectively gather and analyze information about the people you are designing for as well as tools and techniques for designing and testing IT solutions.\nIn this program learn what is needed to design solutions to maximize the users’ experience people with your solutions. Topics include understanding how humans perceive, understand, and behave, gathering/analyzing info about users, and designing/testing possible IT solutions to human problems.",
