</ul>","<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>
<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>
<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>
<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>
<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>

</ul>","<p>Modern systems today must be designed for agility in order to outpace the competition. Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.</p>
<p>Modern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>
<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>
<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.</p>

Remotely Humorous: Build Joyful and Resilient Virtual Teams with Humor,['Naomi Bagdonas and Connor Diemand-Yauman'],,"<p>Brace yourself — you are about to embark on an online learning experience unlike any other.</p>

<p>Imagine your favorite comedy show and the world’s best online educational content had a baby. Then imagine that baby transformed your team to be more joyful, humorous, creative, resilient, and effective, all while working remotely.</p> 

</p>You are about to enroll in that baby.</p>

<p>Naomi Bagdonas and Connor Diemand-Yauman are leading experts in organizational leadership and culture. They've coached celebrities and fortune 500 executives, taught at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, and founded and led multiple organizations. They’ve teamed up with comedic minds from The Onion, Funny Or Die, and Comedy Central to create a fun, interactive learning experience to empower you to show up more authentically, effectively, and joyfully at work and life.</p>

<p>You might be wondering: “Should I really be prioritizing a course about humor? Also, was it just me, or did that baby metaphor kind of fall apart at the end?”</p> 

<p>To answer your first question: humor is what makes all the other stuff your team has to do tolerable. In this brave new world of work, when we rarely see our team members in person — or from the pajama bottoms down — it's harder than ever to foster connection, joy, and well-being in our remote teams. All the while, behavioral science suggests that creating a company culture of humor and levity is the quickest path to nurturing these things.</p> 

<p>To answer your second question: Yes. Just roll with it.</p>

<p>This program is designed for individuals who want to be more energized, joyful, and effective at work and for remote teams that want to feel more connected, creative, and resilient through the most challenging times. It’s also for anyone who wants fewer one-hour meetings that feel like three-hour meetings with only ten minutes of useful work.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t have to choose between catching up on your favorite comedy show and learning techniques for being happier and better at your job. Now you can kill two birds (the Boredom Hawk and the Inefficiency Vulture, to be specific) with one online learning experience.</p>

Everyone tells stories—that’s how we build community and share ideas. However, we don’t always tell our story as effectively as we intend to.</p>
<p>Stories, or narratives, in the workplace may take the form of email communications, proposals, briefs, project or product kickoffs, and presentations.</p>
<p>In this course, part of the Communication Skills Professional Certificate program, you’ll learn about the structure of a narrative and how it varies depending upon the situation, the medium used, and the audience. In today’s world of abbreviated messaging through a variety of devices, the importance of crafting a cohesive, professional, and understandable message to achieve a desired outcome is more important than ever.</p>
<p>You will learn how to create written messaging tailored to a target audience and how to determine the specific medium through which it should be communicated.</p>
<p>You will also study best practices for writing in all forms of media common to today’s workplace, focusing specifically on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure</li>

Though some of those issues have been addressed, substantial barriers—gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws—still restrain the power of the vote. Why? How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally?</p>
<p>This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change.</p>
<p>We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights.

<p>For each case, students visit the HMS Clinical Skills Center to observe the initial patient encounter and physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. Following the patient encounter, students complete the interactive gross anatomy, histology and radiology learning sessions essential for understanding the case. The anatomy learning sessions include observing actual dissections in the Harvard Medical School anatomy laboratories revealing and explaining the human anatomy relevant for each clinical case.</p>
<p>After completing the case learning sessions, students review pertinent radiology images, commit to a tentative diagnosis from a list of differential diagnoses, and accompany the patient to a virtual operating room to observe the surgical treatment. In the virtual operating room, students observe narrated videos of actual surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Clinical content for each case is developed in close collaboration with leading orthopedic surgeons and radiologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</p>
<p>This course will take you inside the anatomy laboratories where students entering medicine, dental medicine, and other health professions study anatomy by performing anatomical dissections.

<li>How to read through contracts to apply these key concepts and understand potential issues and outcomes</li>
</ul>","<p>Learn about contracts from former Harvard Law Professor Charles Fried, one of the world's leading authorities on contract law. Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.</p>
<p>We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life -- agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.</p>
<p>This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.</p>
<p>The course's instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.</p>","['Upcoming', 'Available now']","['Business & Management', 'Philosophy & Ethics', 'Law']",['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,[],['charles-fried'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'German (Germany)', 'Greek', 'French', 'Italian (Italy)', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Thai', 'Turkish (Turkey)', 'Chinese (Simplified)']","['Arabic', 'Turkish', 'French', 'Indonesian', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'Telugu', 'Russian', 'German', 'Swahili', 'Hindi']",29377,https://www.edx.org/learn/business-law/harvard-university-contract-law-from-trust-to-promise-to-contract,8.0,['Contract Law']

<p>""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>
<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>
<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['XSeries'],['jennifer-widom'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Indonesian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish', 'Arabic']",12725,https://www.edx.org/learn/relational-databases/stanford-university-databases-relational-databases-and-sql,2.0,"['Relational Databases', 'Data Abstraction', 'Query Languages', 'Concurrency Controls', 'SQL (Programming Language)', 'Database Systems', 'Database Design', 'Scalability', 'Persistence', 'Reliability', 'Online Analytical Processing', 'Computer Science', 'Authorization (Computing)']"

</ul>","<p>How can we ensure that we don’t fail the next generation of children? What investments do we need to make an impact? What implementation decisions do we need to make for program success?</p>
<p>An estimated 250 million children in low- and middle-income countries risk not meeting their development potential in the first five years of life—leading to lifelong impacts on health, learning, behavior, and overall adult productivity. During this critical time, strategic interventions can ensure children have a strong foundation to lead healthy, productive lives as engaged citizens.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to increase access to high-quality early childhood development intervention programs on national and global scales. While the science behind the importance of early development and funding for these programs has increased globally, policy development, research, and implementation best practices have not been widely adopted. As the COVID-19 virus disrupts health, nutrition, childcare, and education services, and stretches social and child protection systems to their limits, children and families least able to cope are being hit hardest with inequities in childhood development widening. Evidence-based policies that support families and young children are needed now more than ever. This course examines best practices in child and family policies, advocacy, financing, and pathways to scale—showing you how to generate an innovative, scalable intervention strategy that supports early childhood development. ****</p>
<p>The course begins with a review of basic early childhood development concepts and successful implementation programs around the world. We learn why some programs succeed where others do less well and what strategies are key for enabling widespread adaptation of quality programming. For those working around the world in early childhood development programs, this course allows you to reflect and evaluate your own organization by reviewing real-world case successes, as well as a new global perspective from other learners. You will complete the course with new plans and ideas ready to implement within your program.</p>

<li>How to break down silos and reduce duplicative efforts in the wider community health ecosystem</li>
<li>The common issues that arise in implementing community health worker programs at scale</li>
</ul>","<p>Despite medical and technological advances, half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services, and over 8.9 million preventable deaths occur every year. There is an acute global shortage of health workers, a gap that will grow to 18 million by 2030. Studies show that training high-performing community health workers can help close these gaps and save more than 3 million lives annually.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, many community health worker programs across the world have demonstrated their ability to save lives — including in the hardest-to-reach areas. Yet despite this progress, lessons on how to successfully scale these programs as part of national primary health systems are not widely shared.</p>
<p>This course, developed in collaboration with the Community Health Academy at Last Mile Health, introduces learners to the core concepts of community health worker programs, and explores what is needed to build and strengthen large-scale programs in order to improve access to high-quality health services. The curriculum highlights the key components of designing community health systems, addresses common management challenges, and showcases lessons learned from a range of contributors — from community-level practitioners to government leaders and other global health experts. Through case studies of exemplar countries (including Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Liberia), participants will learn from leaders across the globe how to advocate for, build, and optimize community health worker programs.</p>
<p>This course was created by health systems leaders for health systems leaders. Whether you work in a Ministry of Health, lead or support a community health worker program, mobilize resources and advocate for increased investment in community health, or you are simply interested in knowing what it takes to deliver quality care through community health worker programs, learners will have the opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills to implement critical change. This course can be taken individually, but learners are also encouraged to convene their colleagues from within or across organizations to share insights and further enhance the learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['XSeries'],['jennifer-widom'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Indonesian', 'Arabic']",6713,https://www.edx.org/learn/sql/stanford-university-databases-advanced-topics-in-sql,2.0,"['Relational Databases', 'Data Abstraction', 'Query Languages', 'Concurrency Controls', 'SQL (Programming Language)', 'Database Systems', 'Database Design', 'Scalability', 'Persistence', 'Telecommunications', 'Reliability', 'Referential Integrity', 'Computer Science', 'Authorization (Computing)']"

</ul>","<p>Scrum and Agile are often considered synonymous, and there is a good reason. Scrum embodies the simplest and most pure approach to managing project work at the team level. Scrum is employed by over half of all Agile practitioners across all industries. While agile may have started in software development, many industries now use an agile methodology to deliver their work. The basis for agile, the agile manifesto, extends well beyond its origins in extreme programming and agile software development. Development teams around the world are now using kanban boards and assigning strong product owners to direct self-organizing teams to deliver on prioritized product backlogs. And nearly every new product has some sort of IT component and goes through an agile development lifecycle.</p>

<li>
<p>Today nearly 100% of IT organizations use Agile and many other industries are quickly following;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likelihood of being on a Scrum or Scrum-like project is quickly approaching 50/50 or better over time.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the Mastering Agile Professional Certificate program emphasizes principles at the heart of all Agile frameworks, in this course we start by learning the key project management processes, roles, mechanics, and philosophies behind Scrum. This will provide the basis for all understanding Agile in its purest form over four weeks exploring Why, Who, How, and finally What Scrum looks like applied in the real world. From understanding the agile team members, like scrum master and product owner, to the important differences in lean and agile processes.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how scaled agile is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to begin your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Sprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery.”</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

<li>The ownership of human tissue and its underlying genetic information</li>
</ul>","<p>Bioethics provides an overview of the legal, medical, and ethical questions around reproduction and human genetics and how to apply legal reasoning to these questions.</p>
<p>This law course includes interviews with individuals who have used surrogacy and sperm donation, with medical professionals who are experts in current reproductive technologies like In Vitro Fertilization and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, and bioethicists and journalists who study the ownership and use of genetic information within human tissue. Additional Harvard colleagues will also share with you their thoughts on topics such as disability law as it relates to reproductive technology.</p>
<p>While the law and ethics surrounding these technologies are a central component to this course, we also show you examples of the deeply personal and human side of these issues. Throughout the course, and with the help of law students, we will discuss leading legal cases in this field, which will illuminate the types of questions the law has struggled with – stretching and evolving over time. From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years.

<li>Techniques for estimating monetary costs andcarbon impacts.</li>
</ul>","<p>Humanity faces an immense challenge: providing abundant energy to everyone without wrecking the planet. If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? </p>
<p>Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. </p>
<p>This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? </p>
<p>This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance. </p>

<li>How our understanding of history is shaped by which stories are told</li>
</ul>","<p>As we approach the centennial of the passage of women’s suffrage in 1920, there has been a recent burst of activism among American women. Women are running for political office in record numbers. Women are organizing and taking to the streets to demand change. Women are grappling with inclusion and intersectionality. </p>
<p>While some of this activity may have been a response to the 2016 presidential elections, its roots lie deep in 20th-century history — a history richly preservedin Harvard’s Schlesinger Library building on the library’s 75th Anniversary Exhibit. </p>
<p>This course exemplifies the importance of archives in themaking of history. Professors Laurel Ulrich and Jane Kamensky, along with colleagues from across Harvard University and beyond, show how women in the 20th-century United States pushed boundaries, fought for new rights, and challenged contemporary notions of what women could and should do. </p>
<p>Through the exploration of ten iconic objects from the Schlesinger collection, they demonstrate how women created change by embracing education, adopting new technologies, and creating innovative works of art; pushing against discrimination and stepping into new roles in public and in private.</p>",['Available now'],"['History', 'Humanities', 'Social Sciences']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],"['laurel-thatcher-ulrich', 'jane-kamensky']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'German (Germany)', 'Greek', 'French', 'Italian (Italy)', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Thai', 'Turkish (Turkey)', 'Chinese (Simplified)']","['French', 'German', 'Swahili', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Thai', 'Greek', 'Chinese - China', 'Russian', 'Indonesian', 'Korean', 'Turkish', 'Arabic', 'Spanish', 'Telugu', 'Hindi']",4215,https://www.edx.org/learn/history/harvard-university-women-making-history-ten-objects-many-stories,8.0,"['Innovation', 'Archives', 'Library']"

<p>In <em>Tangible Things</em> , you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.</p>
<p>By “stepping onto” the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard’s astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.</p>
<p>In the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.</p>
<p>Finally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.</p>
<p>Along the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.</p>

Solid Waste Management,['World Bank Group'],"<p>Solid waste is one of the most pressing issues of our time. World over, people are generating greater amounts of garbage without much thought. The phrase “out of sight, out of mind” holds true for many of us when it comes to waste issues. Once garbage leaves our homes and offices and factories, do we really consider what happens to it, who’s collecting it, or what impact it’s having on our environment and our health?</p>","<ul>

<li>Distinguish between infrastructure (capex) and operations and maintenance (opex) costs, as related to various technologies, and gain insight into cost recovery methods; learn about various funding mechanisms to establish SMW projects</li>
<li>Examine various policy options at national and local levels to determine what would be most suitable given individual country and city scenarios and learn how institutions and coordination can improve service delivery and financial performance of the sector</li>
<li>Gain awareness of technological innovations in the sector, the key role of informal workers and women (particularly in low- and middle-income countries), and the changing perceptions of the waste sector towards resource management</li>
<li>Familiarize and apply solutions for improvement in the sector, while learning from practical examples and case studies</li>
</ul>","<p>Solid waste management (SWM) is a crucial function of local governments around the world, and directly affects public health, the environment, and livelihoods. However, rapid urbanization and population growth place multiple pressures on solid waste management systems, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the urban poor are most affected by lack of access to basic SWM services, such as waste collection and disposal.</p>
<p>Yet, the sector also provides numerous opportunities: Improving solid waste management provides a cleaner and healthier environment; improves livability for all city residents; and attracts new investment and tourism, which improve a city’s economic competitiveness, creating jobs, and new business opportunities. SWM also contributes to new sources of energy thus tackling climate change challenges. In these ways, SWM is directly relevant to the World Bank’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.</p>
<p>Historically, the highest expenditures of local governments is in the SWM sector but – particularly in low- and middle-income country cities – the bulk of expenses goes towards collection and transport instead of treatment and disposal. Another challenge is ensuring the financial sustainability of SWM projects and cost recovery once SWM infrastructure has been created. The world is generating increasing amounts of waste, with large amounts (primarily plastics) ending up in the oceans. However, there is also a paradigm shift from thinking about waste as something to be disposed – “out of sight out of mind” – to a resource that can be used for energy generation, reduce the use and costs associated with virgin resources, and improve our climate change efforts.</p>
<p>Given this background, this e-learning course is designed to look at the SWM sector, with a focus on MSW, from several angles in order to simplify concepts and promote understanding of this sector.</p>",['Available now'],['Environmental Studies'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],['world-banks-open-learning-campus-3'],[],[],3575,https://www.edx.org/learn/waste-management/world-bank-group-solid-waste-management,6.0,"['Waste Collection', 'Urbanization', 'Waste Management', 'Sustainability', 'Infrastructure', 'Boosting', 'Solid Waste Management']"

<li>Understand how the skills of emotional and social intelligence support organizational happiness and productivity</li>
<li>Develop research-based strategies for strengthening empathy and resolving conflicts constructively</li>
<li>Learn how to lead with social intelligence</li>
</ul>","<p>One of the key insights from the science of happiness is that our own personal happiness depends heavily on our relationships with others. By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>
<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>
<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>
<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>
<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide.

<p>Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs.

They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>The first part of this course is comprised of seven lessons that introduce causal diagrams and its applications to causal inference. The first lesson introduces causal DAGs, a type of causal diagrams, and the rules that govern them. The second, third, and fourth lessons use causal DAGs to represent common forms of bias. The fifth lesson uses causal DAGs to represent time-varying treatments and treatment-confounder feedback, as well as the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment. The sixth lesson introduces SWIGs, another type of causal diagrams. The seventh lesson guides learners in constructing causal diagrams.</p>

The course focuses on a framework of evaluating and crafting business models that attain alignment between an entrepreneurial health care venture and the six factors that critically shape new health care ventures—structure, financing, regulations, consumers, accountability, technology, and public policy. Innovating in Health Care discusses the impact of these factors on business models for three different kinds of innovations: consumer-focused, technology-driven, and integrations which create scale.</p>
<p>Through lectures, insights from global health care innovators, and real-world case examples, learners will explore the challenges and decisions facing real entrepreneurial health firms and how to analyze each situation through the IHC framework. By the end of the course, you will understand how to evaluate opportunities and how to apply elements of successful business models for different kinds of health care innovations.</p>
<p>The course is offered in two formats: an open, online experience and a limited, team-based deep dive experience, where teams (self-assembled or newly created online) can produce actual business plans evaluated by peer teams and the IHC course instructors.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Economics & Finance', 'Health & Safety']",['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,[],[],[],[],3347,https://www.edx.org/learn/healthcare/harvard-university-innovating-in-health-care,9.0,"['Accountability', 'Business Modeling', 'Public Policies', 'Technical Management', 'Consulting', 'Investments', 'Innovation']"

</ul>","<p>What do you want out of life? If you are like the vast majority of people who have been asked this question, your answer probably includes a desire to be happy. Often, though, we do not have a clear sense of what would make us happy. For more than thirty years, psychologists studying positive psychology have asked this very question: What makes people happy? And the research they have undertaken has provided clear answers.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the field of study known as positive psychology, which is the scientific study of “valued subjective experiences” such as happiness, well-being, satisfaction, hope, and optimism, as well as positive traits such as creativity, courage, and wisdom that contribute to meaning in life. Positive psychology focuses on the psychological states – contentment, happiness, and hope – individual traits – intimacy, creativity, integrity, altruism, and wisdom – and social institutions — schools and places of worship – that enable us to live our best life.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the history of positive psychology, beginning with the work of William James, continuing through the theory and research of contemporary positive psychologists. There is extensive coverage of the factors that determine our happiness, subjective well-being, and life satisfaction. Learners are given ample opportunities to engage in the activities that research has shown provide valuable self-care, including expressing gratitude, helping others, engaging in mindfulness, and finding meaning.</p>
<p>Later in the course, we present cross-cultural research on how well-being is measured across different societies and countries, cultural differences in desired levels of happiness, and how policy informs these factors. Last, research has demonstrated that helping others contributes to our levels of happiness. This course explains the factors that influence why we help, when we help, and how to increase helping behavior.</p>
<p>The course has a dual focus; in addition to learning about the field of positive psychology and its research findings, you will learn what proactive steps you can take to boost our own levels of happiness, well-being, and life satisfaction.</p>

Data Integration Platforms combine data into a unified view for secure and easy access by data consumers. Data consumers use BI, reporting, and analytical tools on data so they can glean insights for better decision-making. You will learn about each of these components in this course.</p>
<p>A typical Data Engineering lifecycle includes architecting data platforms and designing data stores. It also includes the process of gathering, importing, wrangling, cleaning, querying, and analyzing data. Systems and workflows need to be monitored and finetuned for performance at optimal levels. In this course, you will learn about the architecture of data platforms and things you need to consider in order to design and select the right data store for your needs. You will also learn about the processes and tools a data engineer employs in order to gather, import, wrangle, clean, query, and analyze data.</p>
<p>Through a series of hands-on labs, you will be guided to provision a data store on IBM cloud, prepare and load data into the data store, and perform some basic operations on data.</p>
<p>Data Engineering is recognized as one of the fastest-growing fields today.

<p>Lean decision making tools for agile project managers</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Agile can often challenge project managers in the realm of leadership. Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential? </p>
<p>Instead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means.</p>
<p>Great leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader. </p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how this new style of leadership redefines and redistributes team roles by: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motivating through empowerment to gain better decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the creativity and inclusivity of a high-functioning team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying and managing decision making biases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiating conflicts across individuals, teams, and organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring success through delegation and powerful constraint-based metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll learn to turn one internally motivated and critically thinking mind into many; and driving speed and innovation through leveraging all talents on the team.</p>
</li>

</ul>","<p>From the printing press to the typewriter, there is a long history of scholars adapting to new technologies. In the last forty or fifty years, the most significant advance has been the digitization of books. We now have whole libraries—centuries of history, literature, and philosophy—available instantaneously. This new access is a wonderful benefit, but it can also be overwhelming. If you have hundreds of thousands of books available to you in an instant, where do you even start? With a bit of elementary code, you can study all of these books at once, and derive new sorts of insights.</p>
<p>Computation is changing the very nature of how we do research in the humanities. Tools from data science can help you to explore the record of human culture in ways that just wouldn’t have been possible before. You’re more likely to reach out to others, to work across disciplines, and to assemble teams. Whether you're a student wanting to expand your skillset, a librarian supporting new modes of research, or a journalist who has just received a massive cache of leaked e-mails, this course will show you how to draw insights from thousands of documents at once. You will learn how, with a few simple lines of code, to make use of the metadata—the information about our objects of study—to zero in on what matters most, and visualize your results so that you can understand them at a glance.</p>
<p>In this course, you’ll work on building parts of a search engine, one tailor-made to the needs of academic research. Along the way, you'll learn the fundamentals of text analysis: a set of techniques for manipulating the written word that stand at the core of the digital humanities.</p>

</ul>","<p>There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today's technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.</p>
<p>We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.</p>
<p>We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.</p>

<li>Understand how chart patterns reflect the principles of behavioral finance</li>
<li>Apply specific technical strategies to the investment selection process</li>
<li>Develop trading strategies based on technical theories</li>
<li>Evaluate indicators and patterns based on quantitative analysis</li>
</ul>","<p>In order to apply technical analysis with confidence, it is important to understand the theory of technical analysis, why it’s a rational approach to market analysis and how this discipline relates to fundamental analysis and investor psychology.</p>
<p>To build that confidence, we begin with an explanation of how technical analysts view the market in terms of supply and demand. We detail how the analyst develops information about the relative strength of the bulls and the bears through price charts and other tools.</p>
<p>Price charts are one of the primary tools of technicians. Charts provide a history of market action and analysts can observe patterns in the chart. As early as the 1930s, analysts determined that certain patterns tended to precede certain price moves. This course reviews those patterns, discusses how to identify the patterns and supplements this with concepts form behavioral finance to explain why the patterns are predictive. Different chart types are presented and important charting concepts are explained from a practical perspective.</p>
<p>In addition to charts, technical analysts also use indicators and various theories to forecast the direction of prices through the study of past market data.</p>
<p>We focus on defining and applying momentum indicators to make buy and sell decisions. Instead of simply explaining and illustrating popular indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD and stochastics, we review historical back tested results of each indicator so that you can objectively evaluate their performance.</p>
<p>Indicators based on the sentiment of various groups are analyzed and breadth indicators are explained.</p>
<p>In addition to indicators, theories applicable to trading are studied.</p>

Many decisions seem straightforward—when to wake up, what to eat, what to wear, what activities to do—but research suggests that even simple decisions are influenced by other people and by the context in which the decisions are made. More significant decisions such as who we befriend, who we choose as a long-term partner, and what career we pursue are similarly influenced by psychological factors. ****</p>
<p>This course will separate the varied psychological factors that affect decisions into several categories. Some psychological factors are intrapersonal, meaning they occur in our own mind. These include cognitive factors such as schemas and attributions, and motivational factors such as the influence of psychological needs. Other factors are interpersonal, acknowledging that other people have powerful influences on our decisions. Another section focuses on the unique influence of group dynamics, suggesting our decisions are influenced by conformity, groupthink, and group polarization. Finally, we cover intergroup influences on decision making, such as prejudice and discrimination.</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to introduce you to the many psychological influences on decision making. Knowing more about the psychological factors underlying decision making will help you make more informed decisions and help you analyze how other people make decisions and the factors that contribute to those decisions. If you are an employee, this course can help you understand how your supervisor makes decisions and how you can affect those decisions. If you are a parent, the course can help you better understand the factors that affect your children’s decision making and perhaps help you shape their decision making. A better understanding of the psychological influences on decision making can help improve decision making in personal and professional lives.</p>",['Available now'],['Social Sciences'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['rita-dwan-3'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Indonesian']",1853,https://www.edx.org/learn/social-psychology/american-psychological-association-psychological-influences-on-decision-making,8.0,"['Group Dynamics', 'Influencing Skills', 'Motivational Skills', 'Polarization', 'Decision Making', 'Psychology', 'Research']"

<li>Case studies of major cities in the Global North and South</li>
</ul>","<p>Did you know that experts estimate an additional three billion people will live in cities by 2050? What will the impact be on the current world population – half of which currently lives in cities and contributes to about three-fourths of global economic output? The opportunities are vast –but so, too, are the potential issues. </p>
<p>In <em>Sustainable Cities</em> , you will learn about the major challenges currently faced by urban areas around the world – including poverty, unemployment, poor housing infrastructure, and constraints on productivity – and the extraordinary potential of these areas to enable change in the future. From infrastructure to culture to economic opportunity, learn how harnessing the power of urban development for global progress is imperative. </p>
<p>This course examines how urban sustainability can be delivered with increasing productivity and reduced inequality; provision of universal basic services and infrastructure; protection of the urban environments; and other solutions and investments, both speculative and in action around the world. </p>
<p>You will emerge from this course understanding how governments, private stakeholders and other actors can improve urban development to heed the call of Sustainable Development Goal 11 – “making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable“ by 2030. </p>

Compilers,['Stanford University'],"<p>This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>","<p>Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed since the 1950’s. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.</p>","<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
<p>An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code.

<li>Understand the basics of a variety of commonly used diagnostic, therapeutic and laboratory instruments</li>
<li>Effectively maintain, troubleshoot and repair biomedical instruments</li>
<li>Sharpen the skill set of troubleshooting a biomedical instrument in a short period of time</li>
<li>Reduce the repair time and cost by using effective proven strategies and practices</li>
</ul>","<p>Maintaining and troubleshooting sophisticated medical instruments is not an easy task. In order to deliver effective care, the technician requires the knowledge of different aspects of biology and engineering. The different devices work in so many different ways and the literature about repair and troubleshooting is often hard to come by. It can be quite frustrating to search for solutions every time the operator encounters a problem. There is added pressure because the availability of medical devices is critical for therapeutic and diagnostic care. The longer a device stays out of operation, the slower the hospital would be able to deliver care to the patients.</p>
<p>This course has been designed by the interdisciplinary collaboration of both TU Delft biomedical engineers as well as the local expertise of the medical technicians of the Nick Simons Institute in Nepal to help new and emerging biomedical engineers/technicians working in low-income hospitals to care for biomedical equipment.</p>
<p>This course provides a compilation of the techniques hospitals use to effectively maintain and troubleshoot the medical devices so that repair time is reduced and the availability and safety of the medical devices is improved. Completing this course adds a complementary skill set to prior competence of the learner to perform maintenance routines and diagnose problems in sophisticated equipment with care. A faster service routine will help smoothen the process flow of the hospital and help extend the care to more patients. On a personal level, the learner can rely on the knowledge gained from this course as ‘the blueprint’ for whenever they have to maintain/troubleshoot any medical device. </p>

<p>To successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.” Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!</p>
<p>(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course. These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/</p>
<p>(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.</p>

"Language, Proof and Logic",['Stanford University'],"<p>The ability to reason is fundamental to human beings. Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.</p>
<p>The fundamental question that we will address in this course is ""when does one statement necessarily follow from another"" --- or in the terminology of the course, ""when is one statement a <em>logical consequence</em> of another"". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.</p>","<p>While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natural English statements and arguments can be formalized and analyzed.</p>","<p>In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.</p>
<p>All learners receive a complete textbook and software package ($55.00 value).</p>
<p>We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.</p>",['Available now'],"['Philosophy & Ethics', 'Math', 'Computer Science']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],"['john-etchemendy', 'dave-barker-plummer']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']",[],1617,https://www.edx.org/learn/logic/stanford-university-language-proof-and-logic,15.0,[]

Effective Communication for Program and Project Stakeholders and Teams,"['The University of Maryland, College Park']","<p>Go beyond the communication methods you learned in the project management training. Learn how to structure your program and project communications for the most effective understanding by your stakeholders, project managers, and project teams.</p>","<ul>
<li>Explain how to craft a clear and effective message.</li>
<li>The Understanding Triad: know-what, know-how, and know-why.</li>
<li>Design feedback so that you can test for understanding by your audience.</li>
<li>Analyze your audience to determine the optimum balance of know-what, know-how, and know-why in your message design.</li>
</ul>","<p>“Everyone communicates, but few connect” is a famous book and message by John C. Maxwell on leadership. The meaning behind this message is that as leaders of programs and projects, we need to be not just communicators, but effective communicators.</p>
<p>Obtaining your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or similar project management certificate is the first step. But, as you gain program management and project management experience, you realize that effective communication goes beyond what you learned in ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" (PMBOK). </p>
<p>Gaining a program management certification or project management certification (such as the PMP certification) equips you with the necessary project management tools to begin your project or project management career. There is more to effective program and project communication than what is on the PMP exam.</p>
<p>For communication from program managers and project managers to be truly effective, there must be understanding beyond what you learned from your professional certification. The communicator and the receiver must use feedback to determine how the message was received and if the communicator created the intended level of understanding in the receiver for the communication to succeed.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the Understanding Triad - know-what, know-how, and know-why. The Understanding Triad aids you in crafting just the right level of explanation for all your audiences. The Understanding Triad will make you a more effective program manager, traditional project manager, agile project manager, or certified scrum master.</p>
<p>The Project Management Institute, Inc (PMI) teaches that project management communication is the transfer of information. The project or program manager sends messages to their project teams, stakeholders, customers, and executive sponsors. If the program manager or project manager believes that communicating a clear message is enough for good communication, then the manager may be fooled into thinking their communication efforts are complete. Even if there is feedback, the feedback is usually limited to confirming that the message was received as intended. However, communication is not merely the transmission of information. The difference can be days, months, or years of wasted time and effort; or successful, early delivery.</p>
<p>Certified program and certified project managers earn 10 professional development units (PDU) as they learn how communication can make a difference in every interaction, and become a truly effective program or project manager. Gain the power skill of communication in this certificate program.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Engineering']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['bill-brantley'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Russian']","['Arabic', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Turkish', 'Telugu', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'German', 'Indonesian', 'Hindi', 'Swahili']",1560,https://www.edx.org/learn/business-communications/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-effective-communication-for-program-and-project-stakeholders-and-teams,5.0,"['Communications', 'Project Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) Methodology', 'Project Management Professional Certification', 'Scrum (Software Development)', 'Project Communications', 'Certified Associate In Project Management', 'Program Management', 'Project Management Institute (PMI) Methodology', 'Agile Project Management', 'Project Management', 'Leadership', 'Project Stakeholders']"

<li>How to challenge the assumption that the play is only about revenge.</li>
<li>The importance of themes like remembrance, death, and mourning.</li>
<li>How the Ghost has been interpreted on stage, on screen, and in writing.</li>
</ul>","<p>In the first act of William Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> , the Ghost of the dead King of Denmark appears to his son, setting off a chain of events that culminates in the play’s notoriously bloody finale. But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeare’s time? </p>
<p>Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt guides learners through an exploration of the Ghost’s uncanny theatrical power and the historical contexts from which the character emerged. You will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and how the Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. By focusing on the Ghost, you will see how the play grapples with issues like death, mourning, remembrance, and the power of theatre. </p>
<p>Through short video lectures, readings from the play as well as later works by Coleridge and Joyce, and conversations with experts, you will develop critical tools with which to ""unlock"" the play's possible meanings. </p>

<p>Dr. Barbara Oakley—instructor of some of the most popular online courses of all time—and her co-instructor Olav Schewe, educational coach extraordinaire, have struggled in the past with their learning. But they’ve found ways to succeed—Barb has gone from a math-phobic failure in high school to become an engineering professor, and Olav has gone from a mediocre, muddling student to become a standout in his graduate studies at Oxford. In <em>Learn Like a Pro</em> , Olav and Barb lay out techniques based on easy-to-understand but cutting-edge neuroscientific research that can also help <em>you</em> master any material.</p>
<p><em>Learn Like a Pro</em> is like no other course on learning—it weaves late-breaking insights from neuroscience into Barb and Olav’s previous research and teaching to show unexpected, yet practical, new approaches. You’ll learn why note-taking <em>isn’t</em> always beneficial and why speed-reading techniques don’t work (they speed up only your eyes, not your brain—but there is something better you can do instead). You’ll also learn why the best strategies for learning a new language as an adult are inevitably different from the approaches you used as a child. And guess what? The same techniques you might use to boogie-down with dance or sink a basketball share can, with clever retooling, also help you gradually become an expert coder or master at chess. </p>
<p>Think you aren’t so smart? Learn why your slower way of learning can help you see the faulty assumptions and discover deeper truths that even geniuses can miss. In fact, you’ll learn how applying useful learning techniques to your slow-learning approach can help you to sometimes perform better than mental superstars. Are you already a great learner? <em>Learn Like a Pro</em> will give you useful tools to become even more powerful in your learning. (Pro tip—what you’ve previously been taught about how to learn successfully is often the <em>opposite</em> of what neuroscience tells us about how to learn most successfully.)

</ul>","<p>Research has been traditionally viewed as a purely academic undertaking, especially in limited-resource healthcare systems. Clinical trials, the hallmark of medical research, are expensive to perform, and take place primarily in countries which can afford them. Around the world, the blood pressure thresholds for hypertension, or the blood sugar targets for patients with diabetes, are established based on research performed in a handful of countries. There is an implicit assumption that the findings and validity of studies carried out in the US and other Western countries generalize to patients around the world.</p>
<p>This course was created by members of MIT Critical Data, a global consortium that consists of healthcare practitioners, computer scientists, and engineers from academia, industry, and government, that seeks to place data and research at the front and center of healthcare operations.</p>
<p>Big data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. The world is abuzz with applications of data science in almost every field – commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms. This course provides an introductory survey of data science tools in healthcare through several hands-on workshops and exercises.</p>
<p><em>Who this course is aimed at</em></p>
<p>The most daunting global health issues right now are the result of interconnected crises. In this course, we highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to health data science. It is intended for front-line clinicians and public health practitioners, as well as computer scientists, engineers and social scientists, whose goal is to understand health and disease better using digital data captured in the process of care.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that this course be taken as part of a team consisting of clinicians and computer scientists or engineers. Learners from the healthcare sector are likely to have difficulties with the programming aspect while the computer scientists and engineers will not be familiar with the clinical context of the exercises and workshops.</p>

<p>Making good decisions with data can give you a distinct competitive advantage in business. This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.</p>
<p>These big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.</p>
<p>We will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?</p>

</ul>","<p>Tomar decisiones en el mundo de hoy, un mundo en creciente complejidad, con amplios cambios e incertidumbre, crea la necesidad de contar con aproximaciones que nos permitan discernir los verdaderos problemas y las causas que los originan. Identificar cuáles son estos problemas, requiere en la mayoría de los casos, retar las suposiciones en las que basamos nuestros juicios, respecto al mundo y sus realidades. </p>
<p>Podríamos definir el pensamiento crítico, como “ese modo de pensar- sobre cualquier tema, contenido o problema- en el cual el pensante mejora la calidad de su pensamiento al apoderarse de las estructuras inherentes del acto de pensar y al someterlas a estándares intelectuales”. El pensamiento critico ayuda en la toma de decisiones en una empresa, en la selección de la mejor acción para la organización. </p>
<p>En este curso de pensamiento critico el estudiante aprenderá a conocer sus tendencias, aproximaciones y suposiciones en las que se basan sus reflexiones y las condiciones y sus resultados derivados de sus formas de pensar. Este pensamiento reflexivo es el examen activo, cuidadoso y persistente, de toda creencia a la luz de los fundamentos que la sostiene y las conclusiones a las que tiende. </p>
<p>Las decisiones razonadas que requiere el mundo, se dan en muy diversos ámbitos, especialmente en las decisiones de negocio, relacionadas con las estrategias, en la solución de problemas en las organizaciones, en la solución de problemas sociales y la responsabilidad social y ética de las corporaciones.

Trading for Development in the Age of Global Value Chains - Word Development Report 2020,['World Bank Group'],"<p>Global value chains (GVCs) now account for almost half of all international trade. In this age of global value chains, learn how GVCs can become more sustainable and inclusive. Explore the ways in which countries can work together to create deeper reforms and predictable policies that encourage shared and sustained GVC participation. Based on the World Bank Group 2020 World Development Report (WDR), participants will learn from Bank economists about trading for development. Especially at a time when the world economy and supply chains are challenged by the COVID-19 crisis, GVCs and their significance in international trade and economic growth across the world are more important than ever.</p>","<p>• Evaluates the degree to which GVCs have contributed to economic growth, jobs, and reduced poverty—as well as inequality and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>• Examines how national policies can create deeper reforms and predictable policies, advancing GVCs as a force for development rather than divergence, and reviving economic growth and world trade.</p>
<p>• Identifies inadequacies in the international trade system that have fomented disagreements among nations and provides a road map to resolving them through greater international cooperation.</p>","<p>Global value chains (GVCs) powered the surge of international trade after 1990 and now account for almost half of all trade. This shift enabled an unprecedented economic convergence, the age of GVCs, wherein low-income countries grew rapidly and began to catch up with high-income countries.</p>
<p>Since the 2008 global financial crisis, however, the growth of trade has stagnated and the expansion of GVCs has stalled. These trends have only been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, threats to the model of trade-led growth have emerged. Technological change could draw production closer to the consumer and reduce the demand for labor. And trade conflicts among large countries—exacerbated by conflict around COVID-19—could lead to a retrenchment or a segmentation of GVCs.</p>
<p>How can GVCs power sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development? How can countries work together to create deeper reforms and predictable policies that encourage shared and sustained GVC participation? How can the development of GVCs continue amid the COVID-19 crisis?</p>

</li>
</ul>","<p>Innovative products and services change lives, and having the right innovative process creates an competitive advantage. Ultimately, innovation is about one thing: problem solving.</p>
<p>As an agile problem solver, you'll need to expand your critical thinking skills to address the key sources of risk in developing best solutions for your new products and business lines. The Problem-solving techniques covered begin with problem definition, beginning with job descriptions and applying the right soft skills to enhance requirements gathering. This ensures you're targeting a good problem to solve, and that you understand the business model. The course then moves on to practices such as ""brainstorm and storm drain"" to target new creative solutions. You will learn how innovation works on fast feedback cycles to test possible solutions and target root causes of defects. Creative thinking isn't a straight line, and neither should the problem-solving process be a straight line. Each course of action needs early and frequent testing.</p>
<p>Key lessons taught in this course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Delivering business value, not technical scope with User Stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why innovating is the key to risk management and gaining a competitive advantage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best innovation process for startups in new markets or disruptive innovations, versus sustaining product and process innovations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to employ an innovation process that fits your business model and situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Cross-functional teams and user stories to gather accurate requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging constraints to apply tested solutions to new technology and new innovations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying Test-Driven Design (TDD) to deliver better designs with less designing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following best practices of Agile, including timeboxes, constraint-based thinking processes, and empathetic problem solving, you'll learn how to provide a sustainable innovation environment for your teams.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile innovation is accomplished in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.”</p>

<p>Enterprise alignment: how and why strategic plans, portfolio optimization, and project management canalign with simple metrics, with facilitative leadership</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience. </p>
<p>However, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transparency with daily standup meetings discussing work status, risk, and pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a clear definition of done drives acceptance by all key stakeholders.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Making the business case for agile contracts and how they ensure deliverables achieve business outcomes and objectives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.</p>
<p>This shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career. </p>
<p>So how do programs ensure smooth project delivery? </p>
<p>This answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it’s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes. </p>

</ul>","<p>In this online course on Macroeconomic Diagnostics (MDSx), you will learn some applied tools that will allow you to assess the economic situation in a country. These analytical tools are the ones most used by applied macroeconomists—including those at the IMF. You will learn both how to technically implement these tools and to interpret their results.</p>
<p>The course will guide you through the different sectors of an economy. It will present tools to assess the relevant sector and its vulnerabilities. These applied tools will be simple to apply and they will bring out the critical information that an economist needs to make an assessment.</p>
<p>Beyond the tools themselves, we’ll also be showing how to refine and interpret their output. We will be doing more than just plugging numbers into a spreadsheet formula. We will want to use the results of these tools – filtered through our judgement – to develop a narrative of a country’s economic situation.</p>
<p>To help you make this course more hands-on, you will be examining a case study country called “Diagnostica.” We will run through a series of sector-by-sector assessments. Along the way, we will be demonstrating how to apply the diagnostic by using different country examples.

</ul>","<p>Program and project managers are master storytellers. They have to be in order to weave high-priority information into a memorable narrative for their people. Customers must commit to and understand their goals, and how the program is meeting them. Stakeholders need to trust the direction and stay engaged with the program intent. Program and project teams and leaders, need to understand what matters and how their work connects to the greater whole.</p>
<p>Storytelling is not a part of the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI) ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' (PMBOK). Storytelling is not something that Certified Associate In Project Management (CAPM), Project Management Professional (PMP), PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP), certified scrum masters, or other certified project manager credential holders will encounter on an exam. Storytelling is something that successful program or project managers learn from years of experience. If storytelling is not on the PMP exam or similar project management certification exams, why should you bother learning how to tell good stories?</p>
<p>Because, human brains are naturally designed for stories. We have brain structures devoted to making sense of the world in cause-effect terms. Good stories are like flight simulators in that you can try out various approaches to a problem before tackling the real problem. Risk management for programs and projects is more effective when using compelling narratives. Stories are also effective ways to transmit large amounts of information to your project teams and stakeholders. People can remember more information and act effectively on that information.

<li>advanced awareness of the relevant market and distribution demands of entertainment industries.</li>
</ul>","<p>This course is part of the University of Cambridge’s MicroMasters program in Writing for Performance and Entertainment Industries.</p>
<p>We will be looking in depth at how to build a screenplay that communicates its central meaning through strong visual images. How do we write a script containing almost no dialogue? And when we do have to use speech, what constitutes successful dialogue for the screen? How will film genre and history influence your writing? What is the difference between a tagline and a logline? How do you write an effective outline of your script for a producer to read? What is a ‘story bible’ and when do you need one? All these questions and more will be answered.</p>
<p>We will be thinking comparatively about screenplay advice from film and TV industry gurus such as Robert McKee and John Yorke - as well as asking you to find your own habits and practices as writing methodology. We will critically analyse the work of filmmakers such as Jeremiah Mosese, Mustashrik Mahbub and Melina Matsoukas. How do our global film and TV industries reflect our social and cultural concerns and needs today? The work of James Frey ( <em>Queen and Slim</em> ), Michaela Coel ( <em>I May Destroy</em> <em>You</em> ) and Phoebe Waller-Bridge ( <em>Fleabag, Killing Eve</em> ) will inspire us to find the stories within ourselves than can change the world.</p>
<p>Successful visual communication is a vital skill in any workplace. Visual images are the fastest way to communicate the most information possible in the shortest possible time, and a strong intuitive and strategic grasp of this process will offer you an in valuable creative toolbox for expert communication in any professional sphere.</p>
<p>Skill transferability, flexible thinking, and expert language abilities are now essential in a diversifying global job market - come and learn essential new skills, and have fun doing it!</p>
<p>You will be set writing exercises over the course of the module, and you will asked to keep a brief creativity journal to note how your ideas progress and how your intuition leads you into productivity.

You will have reflected on how social and cultural mores can become useful themes to create commercially successful work.</p>",['Available now'],"['Communication', 'Art & Culture']",['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,['MicroMasters'],['abigail-docherty'],[],[],1090,https://www.edx.org/learn/screenplays/university-of-cambridge-building-your-screenplay,4.0,"['Influencing Skills', 'Communications', 'Creativity', 'Scripting', 'Television Production', 'Visual Storytelling', 'Screenwriting']"
Sprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery,"['The University of Maryland, College Park']","<p>Drive speed into any project with prioritized backlogs, limiting work-in-process, and engaging the entire agile team in effective sprint planning.</p>","<ul>
<li>Kanban boards to limit work-in-progress (WIP) in a timebox</li>
<li>Time boxing activities to eliminate delays and gain schedule advances and ensure team capacity </li>
<li>Application and iteration of the Pareto Principle for product backlog refinement</li>
<li>Rolling Wave Planning and to ensure you deliver on the big picture</li>
</ul>","<p>Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile.</p>
<p>First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.</p>
<p>In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Agile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.”</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Your Body Inside and Out: Using Exercise Physiology to Slow Aging,['Stanford University'],"<p>This online class will present the latest scientific information on the interaction between aging and physical activity. In an approachable style, you will learn how your physiology changes with age and how different types of movement can impact that trajectory of aging. Physical activity is a powerful medicine and you will learn how to harness its benefits to improve your health and wellness throughout the lifespan. Whether you are new to exercise or a life-long athlete, this class will open your eyes to the amazing systems within your body and help you strategize on activities that fit your goals for a healthy life.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This class is self-paced, so despite the ""One Session Start Date"" below, you can start any day you are ready. We look forward to seeing you online.</strong></p>","<p>You will learn about the physiology of aging and how your body adapts to physical activity in the following categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifestyle Activities</strong> – Like the lettuce in your salad, lifestyle activities will provide the foundation for your healthy lifestyle. Whether it is walking the dog or carrying your groceries, small changes throughout the day can make a difference in your overall health and function.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular System</strong> – Your heart, vessels and blood provide a network that delivers oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products, essentially keeping you alive. Optimizing the function of the cardiovascular system throughout your life will provide you with more energy, reduce your risk for disease and help you live longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Muscles</strong> – Preventing muscle loss as you age is critical to maintaining function and independence. Using your muscles regularly at all ages also reduces the risk for disease and premature mortality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bones</strong> – Often considered a “dead” tissue, bones are surprisingly responsive to the loads that are placed upon them. Keeping a healthy skeleton through physical activity can reduce the risk of debilitating fractures and osteoporosis later in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joints</strong> – Smooth, pain free joints are critical to continued movement throughout the lifespan, so keeping them functioning should be a priority. In contrast to what many people believe, moderate physical activity can help optimally maintain joints and actually reduce the risk for osteoarthritis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain</strong> – One of the best things you can do to maintain your brain as you age is to engage in regular physical activity. New information is emerging every day as to how your brain and body are intimately connected through a bi-directional communication network. What is good for your body is good for your brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cellular Aging</strong> – Many of the benefits you see from physical activity at the whole body level are results of what is happening down in the individual cells. Physical activity can improve repair mechanisms, lengthen telomeres (an indicator of aging) and even reduce cell death. In essence, physical activity can make your cells appear and behave younger!</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Physical activity is a powerful medicine but, in the modern world, we have drifted away from incorporating activity into our lives. As the barriers to daily movement have gotten stronger, the burden to exercise has gotten greater. These challenges are made worse for individuals in midlife and beyond who experience physical impairments or who are new to regular physical activity. As scientists learn more about the pathways of disease, the causes of aging and the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its benefits, better strategies to slow (i.e. “hack”) the aging process have also emerged. The benefits of exercise impact nearly every area of health and disease that older individuals are concerned about including the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, diabetes and more. Through a series of informative lectures by Anne Friedlander, you will learn how your body normally changes with age and how physical activity can be used to slow that trajectory of aging. The science of exercise will be explained in combination with practical tips (such as how much and what kind), so that you can harness the power of physical activity to optimize healthy aging.</p>",['Available now'],['Biology & Life Sciences'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],['anne-friedlander'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']",[],1083,https://www.edx.org/learn/physiology/stanford-university-your-body-inside-and-out-using-exercise-physiology-to-slow-aging,8.0,"['Aging Processes', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Lecturing', 'Human Musculoskeletal Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dementia', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Information Sciences', 'Physiology', 'Optometry']"

<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['XSeries'],['jennifer-widom'],[],[],1082,https://www.edx.org/learn/databases/stanford-university-databases-modeling-and-theory,2.0,"['Relational Databases', 'Data Abstraction', 'Query Languages', 'Concurrency Controls', 'SQL (Programming Language)', 'Database Systems', 'Database Design', 'Unified Modeling Language', 'Data Modeling', 'Design Theory', 'Computer Science', 'Algebra']"

<li><strong>Controls</strong>. Project control begins with the identification of the owner’s objectives and ends when those objectives have been met. Project control is a continuous cycle in which construction managers identify a goal, measure results, analyze and make adjustments, and report results. After a construction project has been completed the team responsible for carrying out the work usually split up and go to various other jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>. The administrative tools used to manage, control, and document the construction management process. Jobsite administration requires diligence for clear procedures and understanding of the importance of recordkeeping.</li>
<li><strong>Law</strong>. The legal rules that govern the design and construction management processes. Construction law is made up of specialized rules and regulations that govern how people behave in the context of a construction project.

<li>Research-based strategies for cultivating mindfulness within yourself and your organization</li>
</ul>","<p>Stress, anxiety, and burnout are rampant across workplaces today: 80 percent of workers feel stress on the job, and nearly half say they need help learning how to manage it. While many organizations may assume that intense stress is unavoidable, even admirable, research suggests that too much stress is toxic to our health and performance, leading to burnout and harming the culture of organizations as a whole.</p>
<p>This course offers research-based strategies for building resilience to stress and fortifying our well-being in the face of challenges. It explains the biological and psychological impact of stress, helps you distinguish between harmful and helpful forms of stress at work, and provides strategies for handling stress in healthy and productive ways.</p>
<p>The course zeroes in on the practice of mindfulness, the moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and sensations that comes without judging those thoughts and feelings as good or bad. In recent years, there has been a surge in scientific research on mindfulness, with many studies documenting the value and advantages of fostering mindfulness in workplace settings. This course covers the landscape of mindfulness science, explains why it’s relevant to modern workplaces, and describes how it can be effectively folded into your workplace, drawing on case studies from several major companies that have implemented their own mindfulness programs.</p>
<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, introducing a half million students worldwide to research-based practices of mindfulness and related skills of stress reduction. In this course, they tailor their scientific insights to the needs of the modern workplace, highlighting stories of success from trailblazing organizations while also identifying challenges that workplaces may face as they try to foster mindfulness and resilience. </p>

<p>As we create more data-driven technologies, those issues become increasingly urgent. We must begin to ask not only ‘what can we do?’, but also ‘what should we do?’ How should we design new technologies to make sure they are used for good, not bad purposes?</p>
<p>The ‘good’, the ‘bad’, and the ‘should’ are a domain of ethics, and a basis for other important concepts such as justice, fairness, rights, respect. They further inform the law and what is legal. Finally, they are at the roots of an extremely important currency in the modern economy: trust.</p>
<p>This story-driven course is taught by the leading experts in data science, AI, information law, science and technology studies, and responsible research and innovation, and informed by case studies supplied by digital business frontrunners and tech companies. We will look at real-world controversies and ethical challenges to introduce and critically discuss the social, political, legal and ethical issues surrounding data-driven innovation, including those posed by big data, AI systems, and machine learning systems. We will drill down into case studies, structured around core concerns being raised by society, governments and industry, such as bias, fairness, rights, data re-use, data protection and data privacy, discrimination, transparency and accountability. Throughout the course, we will emphasise the importance of being mindful of the realities and complexities of making ethical decisions in a landscape of competing interests.</p>
<p>We will engage with data-based contexts such as facial recognition, predictive policing, medical screening, smart homes and cities, banking, and AI, to explore their social implications and the tools required to minimise harm, promote fairness, and safeguard and increase human autonomy and well-being.

Achieving Product-Market Fit,"['The University of Maryland, College Park']","<p>Learn how to truly know your target customer, your customer’s underserved needs, your value proposition, your product feature set, and your user experience, then integrate this knowledge into product and market requirements and positioning plans</p>","<ul>
<li><strong>Determining your target customer.</strong> It all begins with target customers who will ultimately decide how well your product meets their needs. You should use market segmentation to get specific about who your target customer is.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying underserved customer needs.</strong> After forming your hypothesis about your target customers, the next step is to understand their needs. As you try to create value for customers, you want to identify the specific needs that correspond to a good market opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Defining your value proposition.</strong> Your value proposition is your plan for how your product will meet customer needs better than the alternatives. Out of all the potential customer needs your product could address, which ones will you focus on with your product?</li>
<li><strong>Specifying your MVP feature set.</strong> Once you are clear on your value proposition, you need to specify what functionality your minimum viable product will include. The MVP approach is aimed at building only what is needed to create enough value in the eyes of your target customer to validate that you are heading in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Creating your MVP prototype.</strong> In order to test your MVP hypotheses with customers, you need to show them a version of your product so they can give you feedback on it. You will need to apply user experience (UX) design to bring your feature set to life for your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Testing your MVP with customers.</strong> Once you have your MVP prototype ready, it’s time to test it with customers. It’s important in this step to ensure the people from whom you are soliciting feedback are in your target market..</li>
<li><strong>Iterating to Improve Product-Market Fit.</strong> The Lean Product Process is an iterative process. After analyzing the customer feedback, you want to revise your hypotheses based on what you learned and loop back to an earlier step in the process.</li>
</ul>","<p>Entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen coined the term product-market fit in 2007 when he said, “Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” While there are ample articles that mention the term, detailed guidance on how to actually achieve product-market fit is scarce.</p>
<p>Through our course we will explore an actionable model that defines product-market fit using five key components. From bottom to top, we will examine the layers of product-market fit beginning with your target customer and transitioning through your customer’s underserved needs, your value proposition, your feature set, and ultimately your user experience (UX).</p>
<p>Our process is an iterative, easy-to-follow guide through each layer to achieve product-market fit. This process helps you to articulate, test, and revise your key hypotheses about your product and the market so you can define and improve your product-market fit.</p>
<p>Using the principles of Lean Product Process, our course is structured in seven steps: determining your target customer, identifying underserved customer needs, defining your value proposition, specifying your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set, creating your MVP prototype, testing your MVP with customers, and iterating to improve product-market fit.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Computer Science', 'Design']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['james-green'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['German', 'French', 'Arabic', 'Hindi', 'Swahili', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Portuguese', 'Spanish', 'Turkish', 'Telugu', 'Indonesian']",933,https://www.edx.org/learn/marketing/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-achieving-product-market-fit,4.0,"['User Experience', 'Value Propositions', 'Market Requirements Documents']"

A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the nonlinear data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will explore the hierarchical data structure of trees. Trees have important properties such as shape and order which are used to categorize trees into different groups and define their functionality. The course begins by explaining Binary Trees and two subgroups: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Binary Heaps. You will program BSTs, their operations and traversal algorithms. BSTs are an important structure when wanting to access information quickly. Heaps approach access differently and prioritize what data is accessed. Heaps also employ the concept of up-heap and down-heap operations not found in other structures.</p>
<p>HashMaps and SkipLists are the last data structures discussed in the course. The HashMap ADT is a collection of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are stored in an unordered manner based on hash codes and compression functions that translate keys into integers. You will investigate different collision strategies and implement one. SkipLists are a probabilistic data structures where data is placed in the structure based on a randomization procedure.</p>
<p>The course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade.

This course, part of the Virtual Reality (VR) Professional Certificate program, teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.</p>
<p>Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing. We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement. Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes. Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.</p>

</ul>","<p>In this course, we'll read William Shakespeare’s Othello and discuss the play from a variety of perspectives. The goal of the course is not to cover everything that has been written on Othello. Rather, it is to find a single point of entry to help us think about the play as a whole. Our entry point is storytelling. </p>
<p>We'll look at the ways in which Shakespeare's characters tell stories within the play––about themselves, to themselves, and to each other. We'll consider, too, how actors, directors, composers, and other artists tell stories through Othello in performance. By focusing on storytelling, we can see how the play grapples with larger issues including power, identity, and the boundary between fact and fiction. </p>
<p>From lectures filmed on-location in Venice and conversations with artists, academics, and librarians at Harvard, students will have unprecedented access to a range of resources for ""unlocking"" Shakespeare's classic play.</p>",['Available now'],"['Humanities', 'Literature', 'History']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,"['XSeries', 'XSeries']","['bailey-sincox', 'stephen-greenblatt']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'German (Germany)', 'Greek', 'French', 'Italian (Italy)', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Thai', 'Turkish (Turkey)', 'Chinese (Simplified)']","['Arabic', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Thai', 'German', 'Indonesian', 'Greek', 'Russian', 'French', 'Turkish', 'Chinese - China', 'Spanish']",819,https://www.edx.org/learn/shakespeare/harvard-university-shakespeares-othello-the-moor,4.0,"['Storytelling', 'Lecturing']"

<p>Great leaders are just ordinary people with the right skills at the right time. To become a great leader, however, you have to know yourself well. This means acknowledging and embracing your strengths. It also means understanding and learning to manage your weaknesses. It’s tougher than that sounds. How do you know what your strengths and weaknesses are? What are your core personality attributes? How do you make decisions? What’s your decision-making style? How do you know? How do you know accurately?</p>
<p><em>This certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success.</em></p>
<p>Knowing what you can change and what you can’t is invaluable knowledge. Stop investing in trying to change the unchangeable -- your traits -- and learn to work with them. Stop trying to change others’ traits, too. Learn to work with your strengths, build new skills and perfect existing ones. Then do the same for your team. To start, you must have self-awareness.</p>
<p>Within self-awareness are several dimensions essential for effective leadership::</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional intelligence</li>
<li>personal values</li>
<li>cognitive style, how you think</li>
<li>orientation to change</li>
<li>core personality attributes</li>

<p>Verified learners can access the Power Lab to take self-assessments and receive confidential, benchmarked results. In this course, self-assessments include: core self-evaluation, core personality attributes, self-awareness, and cognitive style, how you make decisions.</p>
<p>From these assessments, verified learners can identify their current strengths and opportunities for growth. You can set goals for your own development with confidence. And, you will learn key practices for how to move from goal to action to strength.</p>
<p>Immediately useful takeaways from this course include enormous self-knowledge of your:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-awareness and how to improve it</li>
<li>core personality attributes and benefits</li>
<li>thinking styles and how to deploy them</li>
<li>best practice management skills</li>
<li>personal SMART goals to develop</li>
<li>self-awareness</li>
<li>thinking styles</li>

Nutrition and Cancer,['Wageningen University & Research'],"<p>Cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the leading cause of death in many parts of the world. It causes one in eight deaths worldwide. Global trends show that the majority of all cancer deaths occur in the low- and middle-income countries. Yet, cancer can be partly prevented and many of these deaths can be avoided.</p>

<li>Guidelines for primary and tertiary cancer prevention for the general public and for survivors</li>
<li>Understand the evidence-base for dietary guidelines</li>
</ul>","<p>Can cancer risk be reduced through a healthy diet or lifestyle? Many studies have been conducted on the role of nutrition and physical activity in cancer prevention. This has resulted in recommendations for cancer prevention. Far less research is conducted on nutrition and cancer progression, but the evidence is increasing that a healthy diet may also play a beneficial role for cancer survivors. Join this online course and learn more about the role of nutrition in the occurrence and progression of cancer. You will learn how nutrition is involved in cancer occurrence, cancer treatment, and progression. And you will discover what the evidence-base is for dietary guidelines.</p>
<p>This online course focuses on a wide range of dietary exposures (including vegetables, meat, dietary supplements, alcohol) and lifestyle factors (including body composition and physical activity) in relation to the occurrence and progression of the most common types of cancer, such as large bowel cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>For whom?</strong></p>
<p>Dieticians and physicians often get questions from cancer patients about what they can do themselves to help their recovery process. After completing the course you will have gained a solid scientific basis to better weigh and interpret all the information available on nutrition and cancer and to take care of your own health and/or that of your patients.</p>
<p>This online course is especially valuable for professionals (in training) from various fields related to nutrition or cancer (e.g. nutritionists, epidemiologists, health policy makers, physicians, caregivers, nutrition educators, biologists and food scientists).</p>

<p>(2) People from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) who may be expatriates;</p>
<p>(3) People from all over the world who may be heritage speakers of Cantonese, plan to study/work in Hong Kong/ the GBA, tourists… etc.</p>
<p>In fact, anyone who is interested in learning Cantonese are welcomed to join this course!</p>","<p>Below are some intended learning outcomes for the 4 modules:</p>
<p>Module 1</p>

<p>Know how to introduce oneself e.g. name, origin, etc.</p>
<p>Know the name of some cities and countries</p>","<p>Here describes some characteristics of our course:</p>
<p>- Although there are various free online Cantonese learning resources and videos available, most of them are loosely organized and not as systematic as a university credit bearing course. The proposed MOOC will be designed in a way that help learners acquire the language step by step, following the scientific findings of second language acquisition.</p>
<p>- The comparable existing certificate programmes or credit-bearing courses such as those offered by the Chinese Language Centre of The University of Hong Kong and the Yale-China Chinese Language Centre of The Chinese University of Hong Kong as well as by the overseas universities mentioned above are delivered in the traditional mode, which are bound by various practical limitations. Therefore, the proposed MOOC, which goes beyond time constraints and geographical barriers, will be the first ever delivered on such a platform, attracting global learners.</p>
<p>- Cantonese, unlike many other languages/dialects, cannot be written verbatim, nor does it have an officially recognized romanization convention. This makes Cantonese learning difficult. The proposed MOOC will use the Jyutping system to teach Cantonese. Jyutping was proposed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong, and is one of the two commonly used conventions for Cantonese romanization in academic publications.</p>
<p>- As a MOOC from Hong Kong, some aspects of the Hong Kong culture (especially food) will be introduced.</p>
<p>- Verified Certificates will be issued for paid participants who completed the course and passed all assessments.</p>",['Available now'],['Language'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],"['ms-yuk-ling-choi', 'ms-ching-sum-sarah-wong', 'dr-wai-sin-tsang', 'dr-yan-yan-lam', 'dr-yuet-yee-yau', 'dr-siu-kei-ken-cheng', 'dr-chun-wah-david-yuen']",[],[],799,https://www.edx.org/learn/language/the-hong-kong-polytechnic-university-cantonese-language-and-culture-for-beginners,4.0,"['Cantonese Chinese', 'Mandarin Chinese', 'Time Management']"

</ul>","<p>Igor Stravinsky’s <em>The Rite of Spring</em> premiered in Paris in 1913, sparking a riot and screaming so loud that the dancers could not hear the orchestra, and the choreographer had to shout numbers from backstage to keep the dancers on beat.</p>
<p><em>The Rite of Spring</em> continues to challenge listeners. According to Stravinsky, <em>The Rite of Spring</em> was intended to portray “the surge of spring, the magnificent upsurge of nature reborn.” As you will see, Stravinsky’s description is almost frighteningly apt!</p>
<p>Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through <em>The Rite of Spring</em> , highlighting not only the contributions of Stravinsky, the composer, but also those of his collaborators. Professor Kelly takes learners through the ballet’s development, rehearsals, and finally, premiere performance, and he explores just how and why <em>The Rite of Spring</em> challenged (and to a certain extent, continues to challenge) its listeners.</p>

<p>The research evidence is very clear about the importance of getting children off to a great start in their early literacy learning. Early reading success is the best predictor of later reading achievement, which in turn is closely linked to educational success and healthy wellbeing. How can you as educators, parents or family members, help support children to develop a strong foundation of skills that are critical for early reading success? How can you best support struggling readers to be successful?</p>
<p>Across languages, research has shown that children’s knowledge of the sound structure of their spoken language (phonological awareness) is critically important to early reading and spelling development. The ability to learn new words efficiently, or vocabulary growth, is also vitally important for children to understand what they are reading. Quality shared reading experiences in the early years is a great way to foster the development of these skills.</p>
<p>This course provides a research-to-practice learning experience for professionals and parents interested in the reading development of young children. This course will ensure that teachers and professionals alike are reading books in the most effective way to support children’s early reading skills. The course content will be relevant for all young children, specifically focusing on the key foundational skills of phonological awareness, print concepts, and vocabulary knowledge for children aged 4-6 years. <span lang=""EN-GB"">The course will also include a focus on preventing the persistent word decoding problems associated with dyslexia for children with familial risk, and children with other challenges to learning to read, such as speech and language difficulties.</span></p>

<p>The brain is the control centre of the body, and it is heavily influenced by the food we eat. The quality and quantity of our diet can affect our cognitive abilities, mood, and overall brain function. Our brain can also impact our eating habits, by controlling our appetite, cravings, and decision-making processes.<span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>A diet that is high in processed foods, saturated fats, and added sugars can have negative effects on brain function and can lead to inflammation, stress, and insulin resistance, all of which can impair cognitive abilities, memory, and learning. </p>

</ul>","<p>This course introduces the elements involved in the design of psychological research. To produce reliable, valid results that can be used to understand psychological processes, researchers must take great care in how they define and measure variables, how they sample groups of individuals from the populations of people or animals that they are interested in, how they control extraneous variables in the research setting, and myriad other factors. Psychologists can choose from an array of research designs, including observational, correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental methods. And depending on the design, they must consider the many factors that affect the reliability of those observations and the validity of any conclusions that might be drawn from them. This course considers all these and many other aspects of psychological research. A large segment of this course is then devoted to issues related to how psychologists ensure that the research methods they employ are ethical. Everyone would agree that ethical considerations are one of the most important things researchers must think about when they plan their studies, but it’s also one of the most invisible in reports on psychological research. Any article that reports the results of a psychological study provides voluminous details about the methodology, about issues like sampling and validity, for instance, but little if any mention of the relevant ethical issues, even though there are ethical issues in play at every step of the process. Behind all the fascinating research in the psychological literature are rules, regulations, and expectations about how the people or animals we study will be treated, and about how the data we collect will be analyzed and reported. And behind all those standards are more general principles that have been established from grim experience that includes some of the worst things humans have ever done in the name of science, and other missteps that hindsight tells us we don’t want to repeat. In this course, we investigate that history and abstract from it those principles that now guide ethical decisions about how to do research. To what goals do those principles aspire? And what breaches are they meant to keep us from repeating?</p>",['Available now'],"['Social Sciences', 'Ethics', 'Education & Teacher Training']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['mike-stadler'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Russian']","['Indonesian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Russian']",724,https://www.edx.org/learn/research/american-psychological-association-quantitative-research-methods,8.0,[]

Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['XSeries'],['jennifer-widom'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Indonesian']",676,https://www.edx.org/learn/relational-databases/stanford-university-databases-semistructured-data,2.0,"['Relational Databases', 'Data Abstraction', 'Query Languages', 'Concurrency Controls', 'SQL (Programming Language)', 'Database Systems', 'Database Design', 'Telecommunications', 'Extensible Markup Language (XML)', 'XPath', 'Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)', 'JSON', 'XQuery', 'Human Readable', 'Computer Science']"

<li>The role of design principles and heuristics in user interface design.</li>
<li>The most important principles for design, including discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, and error tolerance.</li>
</ul>","<p>This course takes you through the first eight lessons of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. </p>
<p>In this course, you’ll take the first steps toward being a solid HCI practitioner and researcher. You’ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You’ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. </p>
<p>You’ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You’ll learn three views of the user’s role in interface design: the behaviorist ‘processor’ view, the cognitivist ‘predictor’ view, and the situationist ‘participant’ view. You’ll discover how these different views of the user’s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you’re considering what goes on inside the user’s head, as well as in the environment around them. </p>
<p>You’ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You’ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you’ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. </p>
<p>You’ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing. You’ll learn the limitations of human sensing and memory and how we must be aware of the cognitive load we introduce on the user while using our interfaces. Cognitive load can have an enormous impact on a user’s satisfaction with an interface, and must be kept in mind as you begin your career as a designer. </p>
<p>You’ll finally conclude with an overview of the major design principles in human-computer interaction. Curated from the work of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Ronald Mace, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood, these design principles cover revolutionary ideas in the design of interfaces: discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, constraints, error tolerance, and more. These principles are crucial whether you move forward as a designer, an evaluator, a front-end engineer, or any other role in technology design. </p>

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Corey stumbled into Dr. Friedlander's Exercise Physiology class early in his college career. Eventually becoming her teaching assistant, the two joined forces to discover new and exciting ways to teach physiology to Stanford students. Together they decided that the best way for Corey to really understand the material was to experience a series of diverse physiologic stressors first hand. What resulted was a series of wild and crazy adventures captured on video that provide a novel approach to teaching you the fundamentals of environmental physiology. From cold tanks to aging suits to flying fighter planes and climbing mountains, Corey and Anne bring the science to life. Come join us and be a part of our story as we learn about the human body!</p>
<p><strong>About the team</strong></p>
<p>The teaching team is composed of professors, students, storytellers and video producers. We interface with academic researchers and real life people in order to create an experience that draws life-long learners closer to science. We make fun, experiential videos on each topic that lead the participants into other supporting online learning materials that explain the underlying physiology.

</ul>","<p>Product Managers are masters at internal sales, team building, delegation, and empowerment. They also know that great product management careers are not built alone. From envisioning a product strategy to correctly portraying the product roadmap, the process must be inclusive, interactive, and motivating with modern leadership techniques. As your products grow, you’ll also need to skills to manage teams of teams. This course will enable you to align product teams, product designs, and product development for speed and innovation at scale.</p>
<p>Product Managers have one of the toughest, most demanding positions in the modern product organization. They must be both visionaries and evangelists, as well as facilitators and coaches. Often they must communicate clearly and effectively across a wide range of audiences. To do this well means being the expert in a number of key competencies of leadership.</p>
<p>Modern leadership principles emphasize empowerment and ownership. Meanwhile products require teams to work together at scale. This course will starts by resetting on what is good leadership based on actual data and studies. Not half-proven theories or intuition. Drawing on actual research and met studies we’ll cover the key elements of what makes a good product leader based on work by Jim Collins John Maxwell, Peter Northouse, Melissa Perri, and more. One of the key findings is that a leader’s success is driven by their team, and how well that team aligns with the mission. Understanding this, we’ll show you how to maximize the team’s effect on the leader and vice versa.</p>
<p>Next we’ll dive into how to build the team. This is essential if you want to move the culture and practices of your organization to truly thrive. We’ll also go over principles of encouraging ownership and continuously replenish your leadership pipeline.</p>
<p>In the third week, we’ll look at the core influential competencies of a product evangelist. This means vision setting, roadmapping problems, setting goals and objectives, demoing effectively and more. We’ll also discuss the art of negotiating across departments and interests, and how to manage conflicts to resolution quickly through good leadership and problem solving.</p>
<p>Finally we’ll turn to frameworks for organizing teams at multiple scales of product development. Whether an aspiring product manager or Head of Product, this will enable better understanding of how leaders align teams. Starting with basic Agile processes we’ll move on to scaling techniques for integrating hardware and software teams of teams. We’ll also discuss how to deploy influence and guide the work with discovery frameworks and techniques at scale. Understanding core processes and trade-offs at scale is critical to leading products to success.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Computer Science', 'Design']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['john-johnson'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['French', 'German', 'Indonesian', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Turkish', 'Hindi', 'Arabic', 'Portuguese', 'Telugu', 'Swahili']",652,https://www.edx.org/learn/product-management/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-modern-product-leadership,4.0,"['Influencing Skills', 'Product Management', 'Goal Setting', 'Technology Roadmaps', 'Communications', 'Agile Methodology', 'Leadership', 'New Product Development', 'Team Building', 'Innovation', 'Empowerment', 'Research', 'Sales', 'Product Roadmaps', 'Product Strategy', 'Product Leadership']"

<p>● How to think about project risk response strategies</p>","<p>Project risk management involves identifying, assessing, quantifying, modeling, and managing risks that may face a project. Complex projects face the challenge of accurately estimating costs and completion times, or even of failing to deliver outcomes as planned. Even the simplest projects always have some element of risk.</p>
<p>Ways are needed to identify and manage risks to prevent project failure. A risk plan is the way to lessen the chance of adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>The project risk management plan is the fundamental instrument for identifying elements and activities of project risk management, establishing risk breakdown structures, quantifying the extent of risk, and planning a mitigation strategy.</p>
<p>The initial step in planning for project risk management is developing the risk register. A risk register is a detailed inventory of things that could go wrong. The risk register provides a plan to follow the project through completion.</p>
<p>Assigning probabilities and consequences to the many items in the risk register is in itself challenging. Contemporary lessons from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics provide insights into how to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, the project manager must consider the best responses to risk including how to avoid, mitigate, plan contingencies, or transfer the risk. There are many ways to re-organize the project and ownership of risk, as well as adjust how the project objective is achieved.</p>",['Available now'],"['Engineering', 'Business & Management', 'Philosophy & Ethics']",['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['gregory-baecher'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['French', 'Arabic', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'German', 'Turkish', 'Telugu', 'Hindi', 'Swahili', 'Spanish', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese']",644,https://www.edx.org/learn/risk-management/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-developing-the-risk-management-plan-with-expert-judgement,5.0,"['Planning', 'Project Risk Management', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Risk Register', 'Risk Management Planning', 'Risk Management', 'Mitigation', 'Economics']"

Managing Conflicts on Projects with Cultural and Emotional Intelligence,"['The University of Maryland, College Park']",<p>Great program managers understand and heal bad communication habits and conflicts that arise within project teams and stakeholders. Learn how by leveraging emotional and cultural intelligence using the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM).</p>,"<ul>
<li>Social worlds in the context of programs and projects.</li>
<li>Cultural intelligence and the four steps.</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence and its five components.</li>
<li>How to utilize cultural intelligence and emotional intelligence concepts to increase the effectiveness of your program or project management communication.</li>
<li>How to utilize the CMM tools to diagnose and manage communication problems.</li>
</ul>","<p>Every program and project has a social world. The program managers, project managers, project teams, and stakeholders mutually agree on roles and interact based on those roles. </p>
<p>Great program managers sense, manage, and influence the social worlds across their projects. They bring order and understanding through conflict management and conflict resolution. Success is not guaranteed, and often teams clash as a new social order is established on every project. They heal divides that can grow under the stress of projects and increase the team’s problem solving ability. </p>
<p>Dr. Pearce, the inventor of the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM), explains the social world as a “dance between the two faces of the communication process: coordinating actions and making/managing meaning. A social world is the site where speech acts, episodes and forms of communication, selves and forms of consciousness, and relationships and minds are made.”</p>
<p>Our cultural differences and emotions significantly shape our social worlds. </p>
<p>The program and project manager with good emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence (EI/CI) can better understand and navigate the social worlds of the project team and the stakeholders. High EI/CI also aids in creating understanding in program/project management communications. A program manager or project manager with high EI/CI is more adept at creating understanding because they are self-aware while understanding other’s emotions.Thus, the program manager or project manager can test if the recipient of his or her communication has the requisite know-what, know-how, and know-why understanding of the intended messages.</p>
<p>Program managers and project managers with high EI/CI will be perceived as having a high ethos. Team members will see the high emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence even in the manager’s nonverbal communication. Being more aware of our feelings and other people’s feelings helps enhance our connection to others and make us more credible. Program managers and Project managers with high EI/CI can use pathos more effectively and make the logos portion of their communication more effective. The right balance of ethos, pathos, and logos makes the project manager more persuasive.</p>
<p>Along with increasing the program manager or project manager’s EI/CI, this course will aid the manager in using the tools of CMM. Dr. Pearce created Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) in the mid-1970s. Over the years, CMM practitioners have created methods and tools to make the communication perspective visible. One such tool is SEAVA, which is an acronym for Storyboarding, Enriching, Analyzing, Visioning, and Acting. You can use the SEAVA tool to examine communication problems among your project team members and to generate a solution.</p>
<p>Understanding the different social worlds of your program and its project team members and stakeholders will help you create persuasive communications, have a positive impact, and increase understanding among the project team members and stakeholders. CMM will help you become a master of communication and persuasion.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Communication', 'Engineering']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['bill-brantley'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Russian']","['Hindi', 'Swahili', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese', 'Telugu', 'Turkish', 'Russian', 'Arabic', 'German', 'Spanish', 'French']",627,https://www.edx.org/learn/conflict-resolution/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-managing-conflicts-on-projects-with-cultural-and-emotional-intelligence,5.0,"['Intercultural Competence', 'Communications', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Influencing Skills', 'Program Management', 'Conflict Resolution', 'Conflict Management', 'Non-Verbal Communication', 'Storyboarding', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Problem Solving', 'Capability Maturity Model', 'Logo Design']"

</ul>","<p>In September 2015, 193 member states of the United Nations adopted the<a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld""> 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> and committed themselves to the 17 <a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth.</p>
<p>Goal 1, “End poverty in all its forms everywhere,” calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10, “Reduce inequality within and among countries,” calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world.</p>
<p>This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict.

</ul>","<p dir=""ltr"">In this course about the business of the pharmaceutical industry, students will learn how the economic, legal, and regulatory landscape affect the scientific research that leads to the discovery and development of new drugs. The three-week course starts with a general overview of drug regulation, recognition of patient needs, and listing the distinct stages of a drug campaign. The second week covers clinical trials, research costs, and the effect of patents and intellectual property. In the final week, students will learn about biological drugs, drug approval, drug research outside of large pharma, and the makeup of research pipelines in large drug firms.</p>

Persuasion and Presence for Program and Project Managers,"['The University of Maryland, College Park']",<p>Logic is not enough. Program managers need presence and to move stakeholders emotionally. Project professionals only follow people they both respect and trust. Learn to apply Aristotle’s persuasion triad to create successful communication that persuades.</p>,"<ul>
<li>Explain the rhetorical triad and its use in persuasion.</li>
<li>Establish a compelling and trustworthy presence (ethos).</li>
<li>Create spoken and written messages with emotional impact to build understanding.</li>
<li>Develop psychological safety within your project team and with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>","<p>Persuasion is the central to leading leaders. As a program manager or project manager, you may lead a team with many senior contributors. Often they will have more experience, more skin in the game, and more reputation at stake. As a program manager, this task is even greater because your time is limited and your span of control across projects even greater. Being a compelling communicator takes more than what you learned for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam or Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. It takes program or project management experience and this certificate program.</p>
<p>Program managers must persuade quickly, and with great lasting impact. Program and project managers must persuade and manage their leadership presence for program or project success. Even if you are a traditional program or project manager or manage agile programs or projects, persuasive communication is vital to your success. Communicating more persuasively will lead to more effective risk management.</p>
<p>There are complete blindsports in the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI)""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" (PMBOK Guide). Applying those processes and skills are just the basics of efficient communication.</p>
<p>That’s why certified project managers will earn 10 professional development units (PDU) in this program. You will learn the balance needed to communicate effectively. </p>
<p>Aristotle first wrote about balancing logic, emotion, and presence over 2,000 years ago. Creating a balance between ethos, pathos, and logos, the persuader creates a message that grabs the attention of the audience and engages them as people. A person doesn’t understand when they are not paying attention, is not engaged with the speaker, and doesn’t remember what was said. Ethos, pathos, and logos aid the speaker and the listener, by helping to select information to present and how to fashion its delivery for the best effect.</p>
<p>In this program management and project management training course, you will go beyond the communication skills you learned for the PMP exam to gain your project management certification. You will learn about the rhetorical triangle and how to use it to craft persuasive communications. Social media and online collaboration tools require new ways of establishing your presence and generating trust between you and your audience. You will also learn how to create an emotional impact even through text messages and emails.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Communication']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['bill-brantley'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['German', 'Hindi', 'Indonesian', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Arabic', 'French', 'Telugu', 'Portuguese', 'Swahili', 'Turkish']",615,https://www.edx.org/learn/management/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-persuasion-and-presence-for-program-and-project-managers,5.0,"['Project Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) Methodology', 'Communications', 'Project Management Professional Certification', 'Certified Associate In Project Management', 'Program Management', 'Project Management Institute (PMI) Methodology', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Balancing (Ledger/Billing)', 'Project Management', 'Leadership', 'Agile Methodology', 'Collaborative Software', 'Logo Design']"

<p>As experienced project managers, we are continuously working with stakeholders to maintain good relationships to ensure that their expectations are in alignment with the goals of the project. Having effective people management skills is a crucial component of project management experience to achieving project success. </p>
<p>Linked to the Leadership skill area of the PMI Talent Triangle® as well as linked to the people domain of the PMP Certification exam, this course will place focus on managing the expectations and relationships of the people involved in projects. To achieve the project goals, it is important to have the knowledge, skills and behaviors needed to guide, motivate and/or direct others. People skills are crucial in achieving success. One way to effectively motivate others is to show them what they can achieve through collaboration and cooperation. Project leaders are constantly helping project stakeholders see the potential for success by demonstrating knowledge, skills and behaviors related to people. </p>

<li>To identify different market models and understand what affects the operation of the electricity sector;</li>
<li>Why policy makers need to incentivize investment and how it can be done;</li>
<li>How the electricity network operates and how network tariffs are determined.</li>
</ul>","<p>Energy markets are governed by the laws of economics. Generators and consumers interact to shape the transactions in the energy markets, and thus the energy system. But how does the 'invisible hand' of economics show up in practice? What determines electricity prices and why are they always changing? Why is it so difficult to encourage investment in electricity generation?</p>
<p>This course will help you understand the functioning of energy markets as the necessary first step to promotion of the energy transition. By using the European electricity market as an example, you will obtain a deeper understanding of its principles and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You will investigate four main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the basics of the energy markets;</li>
<li>the operation and design of those markets;</li>
<li>how policy makers can promote investment in electricity generation;</li>
<li>how the electricity network operates and how network tariffs are determined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Insightful videos will explain the driving factors behind energy markets. Interactive assessments will demonstrate how the merit order is chosen for different types of markets and how this determines the market price. Live practice sessions will take you through the auctions and marketplaces where electricity trading takes place today, giving you invaluable knowledge on the inner workings of these markets and the effects of network capacity.</p>
<p>Whether you are interested in learning about how the merit order in energy markets works or how the European electricity market is organized; or interested in understanding the economics behind electricity consumption, examining the economic problems of incorporating renewable energy sources into the current system; or simply want to become informed about what makes the energy markets tick -this is the course for you.</p>
<p>This course will address all of these questions and more. Upon completion of the course, you will be able to take on questions, problems or challenges thrown at you about the nature of energy markets and their operation.</p>

</ul>","<p>The data revolution is transforming the world; and yet much of the value of data remains untapped. This course, based on the <em>World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives</em> , explores the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, while also acknowledging its potential to open back doors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies.</p>
<p>To address this tension between the helpful and harmful potential of data, it details a new social contract that enables the use and reuse of data to create economic and social value, ensures equitable access to that value, and fosters trust that data will not be misused in harmful ways.</p>
<p>Based on the WDR 2021 report, the course provides an overview of the recommendations on where public and private sector investments are the most critical, defines a rich program for policy reform and technical assistance, and highlights areas where global initiatives and partnerships can help to convene and facilitate cooperation at regional, bilateral and international levels.</p>

This course teaches students essential economic concepts in an intuitive manner relevant to the study of political economy. Part One of the course is focused on developing the essential economic concepts. These are then applied to the study of the nature of the liberal democratic state and why it has to be a limited state in contrast to a populist democratic one. </p>
<p>Topics include the contractual nature of the state, public versus private goods, property rights and economic externalities, the logic of collective action, social choice theory, agenda control, the art of manipulation, and the compatibility of two ideas of liberty with the democratic state. </p>
<p>The use of interdisciplinary materials, empirical inference, game theoretic simulation, and cross-referencing with political philosophies and well-known historical cases, provide students an opportunity to connect different perspectives and deepen their understanding of the democratic state in a free society using economic concepts. </p>
<p>The economic concepts developed in Part One of the course will continue to be useful in the other three parts. Part Two covers the nature of the authoritarian state and party rule, rent seeking activity and its economic consequences, and interrelationships between democracy and economic growth. Part Three covers rule of law and their legal origins, consequences of legal origins for growth, law or state as determinants of economic growth, and transition from dictatorship to democracy and their permanence. Part Four is a study of nature of politics in pre-industrial states with examples drawn from China, Europe, the Islamic world, and India. We also discuss the relevance and limitations of the economic approach to the study of law and politics. </p>

Digital Design,['Harvey Mudd College'],"<p>This first course in Digital Design will take you from Zero to One - from no previous experience, to being able to design amazing digital systems. This is the first step on the path to computer engineering.</p>","<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build digital systems at levels of abstraction from transistors through circuits and logic.</li>
<li>Manage complexity using the digital abstraction, static and dynamic disciplines, and hierarchical design.</li>

<li>Begin the practice of implementing and debugging digital systems with appropriate lab techniques including breadboarding and interpreting datasheets.</li>
<li>Simulate digital circuits with a free version of ModelSim, a professional simulation tool.</li>
</ul>","<p>Digital systems have revolutionized our world. From television to cell phones to GPS to warfare to automobiles to medicine to distance education, computers and digital processing have reshaped the way we live and work. The semiconductor industry has grown from $21B in 1985 to $412B in 2019, making it one of the largest sectors of the economy. Computers are also a vital part of daily practice in every field of science and engineering.</p>
<p>Previous generations of engineers learned the “nuts and bolts” of the profession by doing hand-on projects such as disassembling and rebuilding engines. As technology has advanced, cars have become too complicated for the average person to work on. Ironically, the same advances have made computers much easier to build. While most fields of engineering require extensive mathematics and complicated analysis of even rather simple components, digital systems merely require counting from 0 to 1. Their challenge, instead, is in combining many simple building blocks into a complex whole. In this class, you will experiment with digital systems, building simple circuits from logic gates on a breadboard and designing more complex systems with a logic simulator. You will learn how to systematically create digital systems with a desired function. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and experience to design digital systems and be prepared for more advanced coursework.</p>
<p>Beyond the practical reasons to take this class, I hope you find it enormously fun and exciting like I do. There's a great satisfaction about being able to build things. Digital systems are ideal because the components are far cheaper and easier to use than in other engineering fields. It's also amazing to demystify how digital systems work under the hood. I fell in love with digital design when I first studied it in college, and I hope you do too!</p>

</ul>","<p>This Data Structures &amp; Algorithms course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim’s and Kruskal’s.</p>
<p>Prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal’s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest.</p>
<p>The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['mary-hudachek-buswell'],[],[],580,https://www.edx.org/learn/data-structures/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-data-structures-algorithms-iv-pattern-matching-dijkstras-mst-and-dynamic-programming-algorithms,5.0,"['Text Processing', 'Graph Algorithms', 'Algorithms', 'Spanning Tree Protocols', 'Greedy Algorithm', 'Shortest Path Problem', 'Java Object Oriented Querying', 'Java (Programming Language)', 'Pattern Matching', 'Brute Force Attacks', 'Data Structures', 'Time Complexity', 'Dynamic Programming']"

Es por ello que hoy se pueden ver innovadores modelos de negocio, diversas estrategias digitales para satisfacer las necesidades de distintos grupos de compradores, y modificaciones importantes en las estructuras organizacionales.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Este curso se divide en cuatro temas en los que se guiará a los participantes en la identificación y definición de los modelos de negocio actuales, y en las maneras de rediseñar los modelos de negocio tradicionales. Se mencionarán diversas maneras de adaptar las organizaciones a la digitalización, proponiendo cambios en la cultura organizacional que favorezcan esa evolución en los negocios, y se hablará de algunos facilitadores tecnológicos que impulsan la transformación digital. Todo esto con la intención de dar a los estudiantes más herramientas para lograr exitosamente el cambio hacia la digitalización de su negocio. Haciendo énfasis en que la Transformación Digital no es un capricho del mercado. Sino una necesidad que está fortaleciéndose al paso del tiempo y que está orillando a buscar diversas soluciones que satisfagan tanto a los consumidores, como a los negocios. Al final del camino se busca una relación ganar- ganar, donde las empresas se reestructuran, invierten y se transforman en pro de adaptarse a las nuevas necesidades de sus clientes, y éstos generan lealtad en aquellos negocios que les ofrecen mejores experiencias de compra.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Si los retails (o cualquier negocio) desea mantenerse vigente en el gusto de los compradores, forzosamente deberá considerar incursionar en la digitalización para diversificar las opciones que puede ofrecerles a los consumidores y satisfacer de mejor manera sus necesidades.

<li>An appreciation of your own impact on the environment</li>
</ul>","<p>Introduction to Environmental Science</p>
<p>Environmental science is the study of patterns and processes in the natural world and their modification by human activity. To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems. This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.</p>
<p>Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist</li>
<li>The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment</li>

Waste Management and Critical Raw Materials,['Delft University of Technology'],"<p>Learn about waste management and its key role in saving critical raw materials. Gain practical knowledge of the circular economy, recycling, refurbishment, and remanufacturing as a means of identifying new business opportunities.</p>","<ul>
<li>Current challenges and opportunities in resource resilience</li>
<li>Environmental problems caused by waste mismanagement of products that contain CRMs</li>
<li>Waste collection methods and efficient collection of waste in households and at companies</li>
<li>Remanufacturing, refurbishment, re-use and recycling processes of products which contain CRMs</li>
<li>Waste prevention through chain optimization</li>
<li>Benefits of circular procurement to keep critical raw materials in the loop through smart waste management</li>
<li>How product design can support efficient recycling and remanufacturing</li>
<li>How to uncover new business models to reduce waste and to make your business more resource resilient</li>
</ul>","<p>How can we ensure the continuous supply of the increasingly scarce raw materials that are needed to make the products we use every day? In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.</p>
<p>A good number of the materials found in everyday products are now referred to as ""critical"". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance.</p>
<p>Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.</p>
<p>Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.</p>
<p>This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.</p>

Semantics of First-Order Logic,['Stanford University'],"<p>First-order logic is a restricted, formalized language which is particularly suited to the precise expression of ideas. The language has uses in many disciplines including computer science, mathematics, linguistics and artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>We will describe how to write sentences in the language, how to determine when a sentence is true in a particular situation, how to recognize important relationships between sentences, and describe some limitations of the language.</p>","<p>This class is an introduction to one of the basic tools used in the study of logic, a tool that is applied in a range of disciplines from computer science and math to linguistics and philosophy.</p>
<p>The course is divided into two halves. In the first we study a fragment of first-order logic called <em>propositional logic</em>. This language allows us to get our feet wet with the basic ideas of the course. These ideas include the specification of formal grammar rules for determining when an expression is <em>well-formed</em>. Well-formed expressions may make claims about the world, that is they may be considered <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. You will learn how to determine whether a sentence is true in a particular situation. With the basic ideas in hand, you will then learn how to recognize relationships between sentences, the most important of which is <em>consequence</em>. One sentence is a consequence of another, or follows from another, if it is true whenever the other is.</p>
<p>At the end of the section on propositional logic, we will demonstrate that its expressiveness is limited, and that any attempt to increase the expressiveness of the language requires fundamentally new expressive devices.</p>
<p>In the second half of the course we expand the language of propositional language to the full language of first-order logic, providing the new semantic theory. Everything that you learned about propositional logic holds in the larger language, but new expressive abilities are added to the language. We again investigate concepts of grammaticality, truth and consequence for the larger language. We will see that as a consequence of increasing the expressiveness of the language, the required extension to the semantic theory is more complicated than the theory of propositional logic.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are still sentences of English that are not expressible in first-order logic. We will conclude by describing these limitations, setting the stage for further learning in the field of logic.</p>","<p>The focus of this class is on the <em>language of first-order logic</em> , a formally defined language that allows us to make precise and unambiguous statements about any subject of interest.</p>
<p>Using the language of first-order logic we will investigate many foundational topics in logic. We will address such questions as what counts as a grammatical expression, and the circumstances under which it makes a claim about the world (whether it can be considered true or false, E.g. “the sky is brown”, as compared to “oh, my goodness!”).</p>
<p>For expressions that do make claims — we call these <em>sentences</em> — we can further examine whether they are true or false in particular situations. “Aristotle is alive” is a sentence that was once true, but became false around 2000 years ago, and has remained false ever since.</p>
<p>These questions fall into the study of <em>semantics</em> , or meaning.</p>
<p>Once we understand how sentences can be considered true or false, we can investigate important related questions. Some sentences are always true, that is true in every situation — we call such sentences <em>logical truths</em>. Sentences bear relationships with one another. For example, two sentences might be true in exactly the same situations - they are <em>logically equivalent.</em> We will demonstrate methods for determining when these properties and relationships hold as natural extensions to the semantic theory for first-order logic.</p>
<p>Finally, we will explore the limits of first-order logic. There are some sentences of English that are not expressible in the language, and it is important to know that this is the case, and to understand why it is so. This observation has led logicians to develop yet more powerful languages with more complex semantics. Almost all of these languages are based on the language of first-order logic and knowledge of first-order logic is fundamental to understanding them. So first-order logic is a basic building block for the study of these language and is a great place to begin the journey into the field of logic.</p>",['Available now'],"['Philosophy & Ethics', 'Computer Science', 'Math']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],"['john-etchemendy', 'dave-barker-plummer']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Russian']",[],535,https://www.edx.org/learn/logic/stanford-university-semantics-of-first-order-logic,4.0,"['Linguistics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science', 'Semantics', 'Basic Math']"

<li>How to frame a global health problem with a biosocial perspective</li>
<li>How to use a toolkit of analytical approaches to examine global health initiatives so as to identify and implement effective interventions</li>
<li>How to evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned engagement within global health</li>
</ul>","<p>This introductory global health course aims to frame global health's collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:</p>
<p>A global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.</p>
<p>A foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>An ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities.</p>
<p>A sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world’s poorest and suffering people.</p>",['Available now'],"['Social Sciences', 'Biology & Life Sciences', 'Science']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],"['arthur-kleinman', 'paul-farmer', 'salmaan-keshavjee', 'anne-becker']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'German (Germany)', 'Greek', 'French', 'Italian (Italy)', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Thai', 'Turkish (Turkey)', 'Chinese (Simplified)']","['Indonesian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish', 'Arabic', 'French', 'German', 'Swahili', 'Portuguese', 'Thai', 'Greek', 'Chinese - China', 'Russian', 'Korean', 'Turkish', 'Telugu', 'Hindi']",531,https://www.edx.org/learn/healthcare/harvard-university-global-health-case-studies-from-a-biosocial-perspective,12.0,"['Social Theories', 'Sociology']"

<p>The Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Agenda 2030 outline a global consensus on the interlinked needs to curb human-induced climate change and achieve sustainable development. The underlying transformations needed to achieve climate goals and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include the rapid decarbonization of our global energy systems and economies, and a scale-up of new technologies to meet the needs of a growing population. Mining and materials are at the heart of these sustainable development transformations and present both challenges and opportunities. Despite the important implications for mining investments and mineral-rich governments, the world still lacks a coherent vision to guide global actors in shifting the course of mining projects and mining companies in a way that leads to deep decarbonization; protects and preserves our fragile ecosystems; addresses the development needs of resource-dependent, low-income countries; and respects the rights and interests of impacted communities.</p>
<p>This course examines these challenges and opportunities and how we can pursue all these transformations in a manner consistent with human rights, poverty elimination, social inclusion, protection and preservation of ecosystems, and economic development.</p>
<p>This course is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mid- to senior-level government officials,</strong> members of parliament, and parliamentary staffers;</li>
<li><strong>Civil society leaders</strong> with a track record of analysis, oversight, and policy advocacy related to mining, the environment, climate action, or a just energy transition;</li>

You will gain the competence, confidence, and “know-how” to begin planning your very own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.</p>","<ul>

<li>Distinguish common methods (e.g., interviewing, focus groups) and analytical techniques (qualitative data analysis) used within and across core qualitative traditions.</li>
<li>Begin thinking about your own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.</li>
</ul>","<p>In our daily lives, many of us ask questions of ourselves and about others. Some of these questions, born of simple curiosity, resemble elements of qualitative research. For instance, what will I wear today—and what motives, both overt and hidden to the world, will guide those choices? Or, why does my neighbor seem particularly downtrodden today when he’s normally happy? Or, for what reasons is my favorite charitable organization having difficulty recruiting new members this year, especially when the factors surrounding recruitment haven’t changed? These, and other questions, may arise from our observations and our experiences of the world in which we live. As you will learn in this course, these questions become qualitative research projects when the right methods and analytical processes are learned and applied.</p>
<p>Through qualitative research, we are able to explore—through methods like interviews and observations—various facets of individuals’ lived experiences. Qualitative research in psychology arises from historical and cross-disciplinary foundations, as well as from dynamic philosophical underpinnings. We will focus on the past and present of qualitative inquiry, with grounding in contemporary examples across a variety of psychology fields. Through tools, illustrations, and self-assessments, you will learn some of the basics of qualitative research while examining your own research predilections and experiences. We hope you will emerge with an understanding of, and appreciation for, how qualitative inquiry adds depth, character, and nuance to our understanding of humans’ individual and collective experiences.</p>
<p>Qualitative research usually involves naturalistic inquiry. This means that we explore human experiences of the real world as they’re living it, or as it was lived. Qualitative inquiry invites inquiry into everyday living experiences. Through an array of qualitative traditions and their associated methods, we can investigate beliefs, biases, behaviors, routines, roles, cultures, and other facets of the human experience. Here, you will learn about the foundations of qualitative inquiry—and how it differs from quantitative research, yet in complementary ways. Relatedly, you will gain practice in common qualitative traditions—like phenomenology and ethnography—and some of the methods they use, such as interviewing. We hope you will gain the competence, confidence, and “know-how” to begin planning your own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.</p>",['Available now'],['Social Sciences'],['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['mike-stadler'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Russian']","['Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Arabic', 'Indonesian', 'Russian']",523,https://www.edx.org/learn/psychology/american-psychological-association-qualitative-research-in-psychology,8.0,[]

The causes of decreasing customer satisfaction and increasing quality costs are often unknown, so derived solutions often only address symptoms. Six Sigma methods and tools enable a systematic solution of typical process problems and lead to sustainable operational excellence.</p>
<p>Go from Yellow to Green Belt in this project-based Lean Six Sigma course. With the TUM Yellow Belt, you have mastered the body of knowledge of our Green Belt (according to the American Society for Quality standards). Our Green Belt certification requires the implementation of a Six Sigma project (as recommended by the International Society of Six Sigma Professionals), just as the driving experience is necessary to obtain a driver’s license.</p>
<p>To earn the TUM Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification, you will implement a predefined standard project on environmental littering. The goal: “Improve the cleanliness of areas around selected places in your hometown and control the sustainability of your measures.” This project topic supports the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations Sustainability Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</a>. To reach this goal you will drive along the DMAIC, accompanied by a Master Black Belt as co-pilot. The route is determined by our navigation software (sigma guide). We will stop at every important sigma tool, which you will then apply in practice and document in a project storybook. This storybook will demonstrate the operational excellence of and in your work. (Please note: The implementation of company-specific, individually supported business projects for certification are not included in this edX/TUM course)</p>
<p>We will guide you through your improvement project. Each DMAIC phase concludes with a project review by a Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt. With the feedback on your achieved project results, we keep you on track before you start the next DMAIC phase. You will also participate in weekly live sessions online, where we will discuss the tools and logic of Six Sigma in-depth and answer any questions. The e-book for the course, <a href=""https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-31915-1"">Six Sigma Green Belt Certification Project</a>, is included in the course price.</p>

Automata Theory,['Stanford University'],"<p>This course covers the theory of automata and languages. We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms.</p>","<ul>
<li>Finite automata and regular expressions</li>
<li>Context-free grammars</li>
<li>Turing machines and decidability</li>
<li>The theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems</li>
</ul>","<p>We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.</p>
<p>Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.</p>
<p>Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called ""recursively enumerable languages""). We shall learn how ""problems"" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be ""decidable"" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and ""undecidable"" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.</p>
<p>Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Advanced'],['English'],Course,[],['jeffrey-d-ullman'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']",[],516,https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/stanford-university-automata-theory,7.0,"['Algorithms', 'Parsing', 'Boolean Expression', 'Regular Expressions', 'Turing Machine', 'Finite Automata', 'Pushdown Automaton', 'Deterministic Methods', 'Np Complete', 'Automata Theory']"

Nutrition for Healthy Ageing,['Wageningen University & Research'],<p>What you eat and how you live has a big impact on your physical and mental health. But can it also slow down ageing? Be empowered by the science behind diet and the ageing body. Join us and learn to take control of your ageing process!</p>,"<p>After this course you will be able to :</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand what is ageing and what are the main biological causes.</li>
<li>Explain how the food consumption and digestion is altered in the aged body.</li>
<li>Define how ageing affects one's movement, body composition, and memory.</li>
<li>Apply knowledge about nutrition and lifestyle in your daily routine.</li>
</ol>","<p><strong>How your body changes with age and the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle<br />
</strong> As you age, the functioning of your body declines: your muscles become less strong, your bones more brittle and you may become more forgetful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can do something about this! Studies have shown that a healthy diet, together with regular exercise, can slow down or prevent the decline in muscle strength, bone density and brain functioning with age.</p>
<p><em>Are you ready to learn how diet and lifestyle can slow down ageing?</em></p>
<p><strong>Science-based insight in the role of nutrition in longevity</strong><br />
In an era where we are bombarded with opinions on nutrition, this course offers you the science behind food &amp; the ageing body. Understanding the how and the why will not only allow you to make better informed decisions. It will also strengthen your motivation to stick with new, healthy habits.</p>
<p>Together, we will explore what happens in the body and how this affects your functioning. Learn how to use nutrition and lifestyle to slow down ageing.</p>
<p>Join us today and improve your chance at living a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life!</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle over genetics<br />
</strong> In the introductory module, we will explore the general context of the ageing process. We will learn from the so-called Blue Zones, the importance of lifestyle and the role of genes.</p>
<p><strong>The ageing body; your digestion, muscles, bones and brain</strong><br />
In the subsequent four modules, we’ll take a deep dive into the effect of ageing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food consumption, digestion and how medication could influence this;</li>
<li>What happens in the muscle and how nutrition and exercise can be used to maintain strength;</li>
<li>What changes occur in the bone and how to maintain strong bones; and</li>
<li>What changes take place in the brain, specific risk factors and how to maintain brain health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take a look in the mirror</strong><br />
In the assignments you will be challenged to look at where you are now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map your own food intake and compare this with the best diets for ageing;</li>
<li>Assess your risk for ageing diseases; and</li>
<li>Come up with ideas on how to decrease your risks via nutrition and lifestyle.</li>
</ul>

<li>Analyze the stability, memory usage and adaptations of all sorting algorithms presented</li>
<li>Study the time complexity for the AVLs, (2-4) Trees and sorting algorithms</li>
</ul>","<p>This Data Structures &amp; Algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. Both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are O(log n). AVL trees are a subgroup of BSTs and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from BSTs. Additionally, AVLs incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance. (2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues.</p>
<p>As you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide &amp; Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.</p>
<p>The course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.</p>",['Available now'],['Computer Science'],['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['mary-hudachek-buswell'],[],[],485,https://www.edx.org/learn/data-structures/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-data-structures-algorithms-iii-avl-and-2-4-trees-divide-and-conquer-algorithms,5.0,"['Algorithms', 'Java Object Oriented Querying', 'Nodes (Networking)', 'Java (Programming Language)', 'Data Structures', 'Time Complexity', 'Sorting Algorithm', 'Sorting', 'Operations', 'Balancing (Ledger/Billing)']"

<li>Analyser, critiquer et modéliser les situations de divergences et de négociations.</li>
<li>Adopter une posture critique vis-à-vis de soi-même et d'autrui en négociation.</li>
</ul>","<p>Souvent confinée à l'étude des techniques permettant de vendre une encyclopédie en 24 volumes à une octogénaire récalcitrante ou à l'art de marchander son salaire, la négociation est souvent abordée sous un angle exclusivement utilitariste. Mais négocier ce n'est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu'il s'agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d'intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…</p>
<p>Ce cours s'éloigne de l'approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L'approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raiffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l'information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiantes et étudiants une compréhension fine et detaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Communication', 'Social Sciences']",['Intermediate'],['French'],Course,['MicroMasters'],['stephanie-demoulin'],[],[],480,https://www.edx.org/learn/negotiations/universite-catholique-de-louvain-psychologie-de-la-negociation,10.0,"['Spectre Circuit Simulator', 'Negotiation', 'Influencing Skills', 'Psychology', 'Selling Techniques']"

Energy Demand in Buildings,['Delft University of Technology'],<p>Discover how building design and occupancy determines the energy demand in buildings and learn how to (re)design low energy buildings.</p>,"<ol>
<li>All about the energy chain approach, which is a powerful tool to achieve low energy and low carbon buildings.</li>
<li>To estimate the most important heat losses and gains in a building.</li>
<li>How to achieve thermal balance of the building and determine its space heating and cooling needs.</li>
<li>How to estimate the heating energy demand for hot tap water and the electricity needs for appliances and lighting.</li>
<li>How to achieve a low energy demand by optimizing window size, insulation, orientation and ventilation while taking into account building occupancy.</li>
</ol>","<p>Building design strongly influences the quantity of heating, cooling and electricity needed during building operation. Therefore, a correct thermal design is essential to achieve low energy and low carbon buildings, with good indoor air quality.</p>
<p>This course will enable you to understand the basic principles of the energy chain: demand, supply and distribution; and how they relate to design principles for sustainable and energy-efficient buildings.</p>
<p>Second, you will discover what type of heat losses and gains take place in buildings’ operations. You will learn how to estimate these flows using simple meteorological data and construction properties. You will acquire knowledge on how to estimate heat transfer through construction, ventilation, solar radiation or caused by internal sources or heat storage in the construction.</p>
<p>Third, you will learn to make estimates of buildings’ energy needs on an hourly basis by using simple static energy balances: how much energy comes in and out and which air temperature is needed? When is there heating or cooling? How much electricity is needed?</p>
<p>Fourth, you will discover how to extend your estimates to yearly energy demand, which is essential to make sure that a building is energy efficient and to estimate energy savings and energy costs. You will then also be able to determine the size of the needed heating and cooling equipment (which determines the costs of equipment).</p>
<p>Finally, you will learn how to optimize building design and will be able to find out the optimal window size or the optimum insulation thickness for your building. You will know why putting windows on the south façade is not always energy-efficient. You will understand the thermal interactions between building components and be able to make informed decisions on how to increase the energy efficiency of new and existing buildings.</p>
<p>This course is part of the PCP Buildings as Sustainable Energy Systems. In the other courses in this program you can learn how to choose low carbon energy supply, how to create a comfortable indoor environment, and how to control and optimize HVAC systems.</p>

<p>The course explores global order and local disorders to explain why International Studies in the West are moving towards a planetary approach to World politics. Thinking globally helps explain new links between changes in the natural environment (demographics and climate) and changes in governing Institutions. Will societies and peoples find a way to get along together despite intractable conflicts and divergence of social and national interests? Will States delegate enough sovereignty to universal organizations, rather than keeping power within national borders? Will the world ever be governed, and more democratically governed? This course in global politics aims to explore these key questions. It draws on a mix of disciplines - anthropology, history, sociology, economics and psychology - and a mix of paradigms, as no one approach is sufficient to explain the complexity of global issues today. Combining various ways of thinking creates a more complete picture of the myriad transactions that make the planet evolve towards a more complex equilibrium.</p>

Introduction to Pharmacokinetics: From ADME to PK/PD,['Davidson College'],"<p>A critical aspect of a drug involves how a drug is dosed and circulates throughout the body of a patient. These qualities are aspects of a drug’s pharmacokinetics or PK. Pharmacokinetics encompasses how a drug is absorbed and flows through a patient until it is ultimately eliminated. While pharmacokinetics covers drug behavior in a living organism, PK properties can often be predicted through laboratory tests for a compound’s ADME properties. ADME stands for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The PK and ADME properties of potential drug are closely monitored throughout the discovery and early development stages of a drug campaign.</p>","<ul>

The three-week course starts with the use of drug concentration-time data points to determine the key pharmacokinetic parameters of a compound. The second week focuses on the types of laboratory and animal studies that assist in the prediction of the human PK properties of a compound. In the final week, students will learn how the PK properties are used with efficacy data to predict the human efficacious dose and assist in drug formulation.</p>

Students in the course should understand human anatomy and cell structure. Students should also be comfortable with algebraic expressions, including logarithmic and exponential functions. A fundamental understanding of the structure of organic molecules and their functional groups will also be helpful. The course is designed in modules. Each module opens with a short video on a selected topic. The module continues with a short reading or exercise with an assessment activity. Each module will require approximately 1 hour to complete, and the course includes 15 modules. Two approaches to the course are recommended. One, a student might spend an hour per day on the course and complete all 15 modules in approximately three weeks. Two, a student with additional available time may be able to work through the entire course in just a single week or over an extended weekend.</p>

<li><p dir=""ltr"">Identify and explain examples of public-private partnerships and solutions aiming to serve vulnerable and Global South populations.</p></li>
</ul>","<p dir=""ltr"">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development outlines 17 goals and 169 targets aimed at transforming the world in four key areas: economic prosperity, social equity, environmental sustainability, and good governance. Adopted by all 193 UN member states, the SDGs offer a clear blueprint for global progress and foster collaboration between public and private stakeholders toward a more sustainable future.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Insurance, through social protection programs and private sector solutions, is crucial for advancing the SDGs. It provides financial protection and resilience to individuals, families, communities, and businesses during adversity. Insurance and the 2030 Agenda are closely aligned in principle; Insurance operates on the idea that many contribute so that a few can be supported in times of need, whether due to illness, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events. This mirrors the core commitment of the SDGs to ""Leave No One Behind,"" ensuring that even the most vulnerable are protected and supported.<b style=""font-weight: normal;""></b></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Social protection programs, funded by government tax policies, help mitigate economic shocks by covering risks such as unemployment, illness, disability, and old age. These programs reduce poverty and vulnerability, enabling individuals to invest in their well-being. Private insurance complements these efforts by covering additional risks that governments often cannot, filling crucial gaps and enhancing financial resilience. Together, these systems significantly contribute to social sustainability and the achievement of the SDGs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

This course, led by industry experts, UN representatives, and academics, will explore the intersection of private sector solutions and the SDGs, highlighting the pivotal role insurance plays in advancing the global agenda. While acknowledging that insurance is not a ""cure-all"" for the world’s challenges, the course will showcase how private insurance can contribute meaningfully to specific goals and targets. Through data-driven insights and real-world examples, participants will learn how the insurance industry is innovating and scaling impactful solutions, including public-private partnerships, with a particular emphasis on supporting vulnerable populations and regions in the Global South.

<p>For an individual, it is difficult to avoid, for a prolonged period, threatening external event or situation which engenders a feeling of anxiety, tension and worry i.e., stress. </p>
<p>This gives rise to some obvious questions like ‘How does one get into stressful condition?’, ‘Why do I feel drained out?’, ‘Is it good to take extra load for growth?’, ‘Does time-management help managing stress?’, ‘Is managing stress in my hands?’ ‘How as an individual should I approach and manage my stress and lead a controlled life?’.</p>
<p>This course addresses the above questions encompassing understanding of stress, stressors and ways to deal with stress.</p>
<p>This course will be useful for every individual, irrespective of one’s profession, even for the homemaker and the freelancer, to understand and manage stress and acquire this important life-skill and thereby keep one’s mind and body healthy.</p>",['Available now'],['Health & Safety'],['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],['havyang-zala'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish', 'Indonesian', 'Arabic']",426,https://www.edx.org/learn/health-wellness/state-bank-of-india-stress-management,4.0,"['Management', 'Stress Management', 'Psychology']"
Islamic Bioethics,['Hamad Bin Khalifa University'],"<p>This course provides an introductory, accessible but also in-depth overview of the emerging and promising field of Islamic Bioethics. It is developed and taught by one of the world’s leading scholars in Islamic Ethics, Dr. Mohammed Ghaly (Professor of Islam and Biomedical Ethics). The course explores how the rich Islamic moral tradition engages with the complex questions triggered by the cutting-edge biomedical advancements.</p>","<p>This course is tailored for those working in the healthcare professions and for academic researchers with interest in a wide range of fields, including ethics, bioethics, religious studies, intercultural studies, Islamic studies, and social sciences.</p>
<p>The course will help both groups to learn the internal dynamics and methodological aspects of Islamic Bioethics and how they result in concrete moral positions. They will also learn how the proponents of each position try to defend the correctness of their standpoint and its compliance with the Quran, Sunna, the scholarly disciplines rooted in the Islamic tradition along with its compatibility with modern biomedical sciences.</p>","<p>How does a world religion like Islam engage with the moral questions and challenges posed by modern biomedical advancements? Who contributes to the Islamic discourse on bioethical issues, like the beginning and end of human life, abortion, human milk banks, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), palliative care, brain death, euthanasia, pandemics like the recent COVID-19, etc.? How are diverse bioethical perspectives deliberated and how are mainstream positions developed? When do Islamic bioethical deliberations interact, agree or disagree with parallel discussions from outside the Islamic tradition and why?</p>
<p>Such questions are thoroughly addressed throughout this ten-week course. As outlined in the Introductory Video, the course will do justice to the complex character of these questions. Thus, rather than providing only simple answers, the focus will be on explaining well-argued insights, understanding the diversity within the Islamic discourse, and showing how disciplines from inside and outside the Islamic tradition contribute to, and shape, the field of Islamic Bioethics.</p>",['Available now'],"['Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Philosophy & Ethics']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,[],['mohammed-ghaly'],[],[],425,https://www.edx.org/learn/ethics/hamad-bin-khalifa-university-islamic-bioethics,10.0,"['Palliative Care', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Bioethics']"

<li>The definition and the implications of credit risk for banks and other financial institutions</li>
<li>The most recent risk regulations for banks: Basel II and Basel III</li>
<li>How to critically use basic measures of risk like Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall: computation and interpretation</li>
<li>The definition and the use of credit ratings</li>
<li>How to define the probability of default of a counterparty</li>
<li>Important credit risk models like Merton’s model, the Moody’s KMV model, CreditMetrics™ and Credit Risk Plus™</li>
<li>The basics of Credit Default Swaps (CDS)</li>
<li>What stress-testing is and why it is useful</li>
</ul>","<p>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>
<p>According to the Basel Accords, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today’s world.</p>
<p>This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.</p>",['Available now'],"['Business & Management', 'Data Analysis & Statistics', 'Economics & Finance']",['Intermediate'],['English'],Course,[],"['fang-fang', 'pasquale-cirillo']",[],[],423,https://www.edx.org/learn/risk-management/delft-university-of-technology-an-introduction-to-credit-risk-management,7.0,"['Credit Risk', 'Credit Risk Management', 'Financial Crisis', 'Operational Risk', 'Hedging', 'Market Risk', 'Manifests', 'Loans']"

</ul>","<p>In this course, we begin with approaches to visualization of genome-scale data, and provide tools to build interactive graphical interfaces to speed discovery and interpretation. Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as ""back ends"" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.</p>
<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>

<p>Theatrical scenography is made of several complex phases aiming at recreating an intended illusory effect sketched first by the scenographer. The sketch is made in perspective and it consists in a painting containing all the instructions needed for its exact implementation on the stage. In fact, the planning, control and reproduction of a specific desidered illusion in a scene has been granted for centuries now, by perspective. This MOOC will present some of the essential geometric principles on the accelerated solid perspective, i.e. an illusory method used for the construction of a physical space tricking the audience with greater depths than there actually are on the stage. Moreover, the students will master the geometry behind the scenic reproduction of the sketch: from the two-dimensional painting to the three-dimensional space of the stage, by going on a short journey through the historical phases of scenography from the XVIth century to today and through the acquisition of fundamental concepts of this discipline. </p>

<p>In this course, you will learn how to use the TU Delft mind-set to investigate the causes of such events so you can prevent them in the future.</p>
<p>When, for instance, hundreds of hospital patients worldwide got infected after having gall bladder treatments, forensic engineering helped reveal how the design and use of the medical instruments could cause such widespread infections. As a result, changes were made to the instrument design and the procedural protocols in hospitals. Learning from failure in this case benefitted patient health and safety across the world.</p>
<p>After taking this course you will have an understanding of failures and the investigation processes used to find their causes. You will learn how to apply lessons gained from investigating previous failures into new designs and procedures.</p>
<p>The TU Delft Forensic Engineering mind-set involves recommendations for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection ranging from desk studies (theoretical/predicted performance of structures) to field investigations (actual performance of failed structures)</li>
<li>Hypothesis generation techniques for technical and procedural causes of failure</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing for engineering aspects of forensic cases</li>
<li>Reporting findings about the most likely causes and consequences</li>
<li>Improving engineering designs based on lessons learned from forensic cases</li>
</ul>
<p>The course uses case studies from Building Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Biomechanical Engineering. All of these provide great examples that illustrate the approaches and highlight technical and procedural causes of failure.

</ul>","<p>Plus de 50 % des gestionnaires ont tendance à ne rien faire lors d’un conflit. En effet, la plupart des gens se sentent souvent démunis face aux situations conflictuelles. Il en résulte que les conflits s’aggravent et le climat de travail se détériore. Dans certains cas, les conflits peuvent mener à des plaintes pour harcèlement psychologique. Des conflits qui auraient pu être désamorcés relativement facilement deviennent des sources de coûts organisationnels élevés. </p>
<p>Lorsque vient le temps d'intervenir pour désamorcer une situation conflictuelle, plusieurs questions se posent. Comment cerner le nœud du problème? Comment éviter l'escalade? Comment traiter avec les personnes difficiles? Comment éviter que la situation se répète? À cet effet, l'utilisation d'un cadre d'intervention peut s'avérer très utile. </p>
<p>À partir des plus récentes recherches et des meilleures pratiques professionnelles, le cours propose un modèle d'analyse et d'intervention pour désamorcer les conflits organisationnels. Des stratégies concrètes sont proposées. De plus, études de cas et exercices pratiques permettent de tester l'application des principes du cours à des situations conflictuelles. En intégrant le modèle d'intervention et les stratégies présentées, les participants au cours seront en mesure de désamorcer les conflits avant que ceux-ci ne perturbent le climat de travail. </p>
<p>Tout gestionnaire ou futur gestionnaire devrait suivre ce cours. Les études démontrent que les gestionnaires passent environ 20 % à 30 % de leur temps à gérer des situations conflictuelles.

</li>
<li>
<p>User, Client and Citizen Experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UX ROI and KPIs</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>The user experience is defined as the result of the internal states (eg expectations, predispositions) of a user, the characteristics of a system (eg complexity, usability) and the context of use of the interaction between the user and the system (eg in organization, in private).</p>
<p>Organizations value innovative and well-designed user experiences for their customers and employees, whether they are using their websites, mobile applications, self-service kiosks in store, or various internal interfaces. The practice of UX design uses the user-centered approach and covers 3 main activities: UX research (getting to know the users and their contexts), activities surrounding ideation (such as ""design thinking"" and participatory design) and prototyping. This course teaches methods, techniques and digital tools specific to UX in today's business context.</p>
<p>A UX professional is able to intervene in the design process of a digital product or service in order to ensure a user-centered approach. This allows the organization to respond to the expectations of its users. A UX professional mobilizes a range of interview and observation methodologies until the development of a prototyped interface.</p>
<p>UXPA defines user experience professionals as specialists involved in research, design and evaluation of products and services. Conceptually, this notion of user experience emerges from the human-centered design approach in the field of human machine interaction and human factors in industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Research corresponds to the activity of learning about user interfaces and the context in which they will be used.</p>
<p>Evaluation corresponds to user observation when using these interfaces, as much before, during and after the design and development of the product.</p>
<p>Design corresponds to the standards and principles of design of digital products or services offering optimal user experiences.</p>

<p>Great leaders are just ordinary people with the right skills at the right time. To become a great leader, however, you have to know yourself well. What are your core personality attributes? How do you make decisions? What’s your decision-making style? How do you know?</p>
<p>This certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, MBTI for short. It is the most frequently used assessment of personality type in the world. Nearly 90% of the Fortune 100 companies use MBTI for recruitment, promotions, job-fit decisions, and building more effective teams.</p>
<p>Within this course, you will find the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is personality type</li>

</ul>
<p>Core personality traits are much more difficult to change than any single Power Skill. So, it’s very important to understand your type, its strengths &amp; weaknesses, and how to use your understanding of your type to be happier and happier at work. Personality type describes how you prefer to get data, make decisions, generate energy and are oriented to the outside world. These are preferences which are your personality's default setting. Your behavior may differ, may have to differ sometimes from your preferences, but that takes extra energy to do.</p>
<p>Your take-aways from this course will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding of type</li>
<li>difference between preferences and behavior</li>
<li>characteristics typical of each preference pair <ul>
<li>Generate energy: extroversion/introversion</li>

Animal Behaviour in Conservation,['Wageningen University & Research'],<p>How can we coexist with wildlife in our rapidly changing human-dominated world? The instructors behind Wageningen University &amp; Research’s high ranking ‘Introduction to Animal Behaviour’ have created a sequel. Equip yourself with the skills to assess human-caused impact on diverse species. Learn to apply behavioural principles to design more effective conservation actions. Enrol now.</p>,"<ul>
<li>Connect key behavioural concepts to relevant conservation challenges </li>
<li>Understand how animals use behaviour to mitigate anthropogenic threats</li>
<li>Recognize which behavioural traits can serve as threat and management indicators</li>
<li>Identify successful examples of behaviour-based conservation management</li>
<li>Use relevant resources to find species-specific information on biology and conservation challenges </li>
<li>Design a basic species action plan incorporating a behaviour-based conservation action</li>
</ul>","<p><strong>Biodiversity in crisis<br />
</strong> Climate change. Habitat destruction. Overexploitation. Wild animals face anthropogenic threats from the growing human population and our increasing consumption rate. Biodiversity is declining, with over 40,000 species threatened with extinction - over a quarter of the species assessed. At the same time, some species have learnt to exploit new opportunities in human-dominated landscapes, leading to human-wildlife conflicts. We live in a shared world, and the only way forward is sustainable coexistence with wildlife. For this we vitally need the animal perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Take the animal perspective<br />
</strong> Developed by the makers of the popular MOOC ‘Introduction to Animal Behaviour’, this course helps you take the ‘conservation behaviour’ perspective in major conservation challenges, such as environmental change, human-wildlife conflict and wildlife reintroductions.</p>
<p><strong>Design innovative conservation interventions<br />
</strong> We will explore key concepts from animal behaviour and apply them to practical wildlife conservation issues. Such behaviour-sensitive management has led to successful conservation interventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wind farm with technology warning for migrating birds decreased soaring bird mortality to zero with a shutdown period of only 0.2–1.2%.</li>
<li>A livestock grazing strategy avoiding cheetah communication hubs reduced livestock losses with 86%.</li>
<li>A mammal translocation program taking neighbour relations into account led to 24 times more offspring for translocated individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through informative knowledge clips, case studies, interviews, and practical assignments, you’ll learn how you can use animal behaviour in conservation to effectively monitor threats, increase your understanding of the diverse responses to environmental change, and design innovative interventions.</p>
<p><strong>For whom?<br />
</strong> For professionals working with wildlife, this course will build understanding of how animal behaviour mediates the impact of anthropogenic threats on animal populations. It will become clear how behavioural principles can be used to make behaviour-based management decisions. <br />
Students of wildlife conservation or animal behaviour will be able to expand their knowledge into a complementary field. Learn how to integrate academic knowledge of behaviour with threatened species conservation planning.</p>
<p>So, whether you are a wildlife conservation practitioner, a student in environmental or animal sciences, or simply someone with a general interest in animal behaviour or conservation, join us!</p>",['Available now'],"['Biology & Life Sciences', 'Environmental Studies', 'Science']",['Introductory'],['English'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],"['dr-james-savage', 'prof-marc-naguib', 'dr-lysanne-snijders']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Spanish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Indonesian', 'Arabic']",380,https://www.edx.org/learn/animal-behavior/wageningen-university-research-animal-behaviour-in-conservation,5.0,"['Animal Science', 'Communications', 'Conservation Planning', 'Wildlife Conservation', 'Management', 'Innovation', 'Research']"

</ul>","<p>Véritable phénomène de société, le management couvre un territoire immense. Borné d’un côté par des théories aussi foisonnantes qu’hétéroclites et de l’autre par des pratiques indéfiniment variées, le territoire du management est d’une richesse inouïe. </p>
<p>Cela dit, le management contemporain reste encore à inventer. Pour y parvenir, le gestionnaire d’aujourd’hui peut puiser dans l’histoire des théories du management. Il y trouvera toute une variété de solutions pratiques et de regards interprétatifs. Mais parce qu’il n’existe pas une telle chose qu’une théorie parfaite, le gestionnaire ne dispose que de solutions partielles et incomplètes. </p>
<p>Surtout, sa pratique concrète doit nécessairement osciller entre deux pôles complémentaires. D’un côté, il doit faire preuve d’efficacité et pour y parvenir, il dispose d’un grand nombre de techniques administratives et de règles de gestion qui le conduisent alors à penser l’organisation en termes juridiques, stratégiques, structurels et opérationnels. De l’autre, il ne peut pas se contenter d’être un technicien qui ne viserait que l’efficacité formelle; il doit aussi être profondément humain et inscrire son action dans le tissu social d’une organisation et du coup entrevoir ses dimensions politiques, symboliques, psychologiques et cognitives. </p>
<p>Ce cours de management s’adresse à celles et ceux qui sont à la recherche d’une meilleure compréhension des théories et des pratiques du management. Il fait une large place aux exemples tirés de la pratique et se réfère autant aux théoriciens qu’aux praticiens. Ce cours propose de regarder le management à travers trois regards complémentaires : </p>
<ul>
<li>celui du management formel qui s’appuie sur la raison formelle et se donne comme idéal l’efficacité;</li>
<li>celui du management charismatique qui s’appuie sur le charisme et se donne comme idéal la création;</li>
<li>et celui du management traditionnel qui s’appuie sur la tradition et se donne comme idéal l’harmonie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Les adeptes du management au sens technique se limitent au premier; les adeptes du leadership ne jurent que par le deuxième et, malgré la fascination que la nouveauté exerce dans l’univers de la gestion, la tradition persiste dans bien des organisations. Pourtant, le gestionnaire est toujours, d’une certaine manière, confronté à ces trois logiques. Inventer le management contemporain pour répondre aux défis des Temps présents consiste à combiner de manière originale ces trois logiques.</p>",['Available now'],['Business & Management'],['Introductory'],['French'],Course,['Professional Certificate'],['gilles-cazabon'],"['Arabic', 'English', 'Spanish (Latin America)', 'Indonesian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)']","['Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Indonesian']",374,https://www.edx.org/learn/management/hec-montreal-le-management,5.0,"['Management', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Textiles']"
