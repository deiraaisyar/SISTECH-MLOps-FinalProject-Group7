But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.</p>\n<p>\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life.

         "<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>\n<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>\n<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>\n<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>\n<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>\n<p><em>\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives. Few of us are going back to the way we worked. Read her book and begin to prepare for the other side of this pandemic now.\" - Larry Culp, CEO of GE</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I often talk about the importance of trust when it comes to work: the trust of your employees, and building trust with your customers. This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment.\" - Eric S. Yuan, Founder &amp; CEO, Zoom</em></p>",

         "<p>People who are happier at work are more committed to their organization, rise to positions of leadership more rapidly, are more productive and creative, and suffer fewer health problems. More and more, research is suggesting that happiness should not be an afterthought for workplaces; it should be an essential goal, entwined with the kinds of 21st century skills that are key to individual and organizational success today. But how can you increase happiness at work within yourself and across your organization? \r\n\r\n<p>In the Science of Happiness at Work Professional Certificate program, you will learn the hallmarks and benefits of a happy workplace, and you’ll come away with concrete, research-based strategies you can implement—individually or in teams—to boost your own emotional well-being, support the well-being of colleagues and employees, and foster a workplace culture of happiness. All lessons in the program are based on the most up-to-date scientific research, particularly from the fields of psychology, business, and neuroscience.\r\n\r\n<p>Over its three courses, the program will explain why happiness matters for your workplace; offer specific practices for fostering positive emotions like gratitude; help you build resilience to stress, particularly through the practice of mindfulness; and teach the importance of positive, trusting, collaborative relationships at work, drawing on the skills of empathy and emotional intelligence. Woven throughout the courses will be special tips for workplace leaders, helping them understand how to build a positive organizational culture through socially intelligent leadership.\r\n\r\n<p>The program will be taught by expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center (GGSC), a leading authority on the science of happiness. They will build on insights from the GGSC’s Science of Happiness MOOC, the global phenomenon that has brought this science to half a million students worldwide. This new program will zero in on the particular challenges—and opportunities—in bringing a greater sense of happiness and meaning to your life at work. Insights from leading scientific studies will be distilled into actionable lessons, and they will be brought to life by real-world case studies. \r\n\r\n<p>In completing this program, you’ll not only be better equipped to identify the level of happiness within your organization and help colleagues understand why happiness is a worthwhile goal. You’ll also be equipped to support engagement and productivity within your organization and strengthen your sense of belonging, purpose, meaning, and satisfaction—not only at the office but in your life as a whole.",

This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>\r\n<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point.

And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls.

Also, was it just me, or did that baby metaphor kind of fall apart at the end?”</p> \r\n\r\n<p>To answer your first question: humor is what makes all the other stuff your team has to do tolerable. In this brave new world of work, when we rarely see our team members in person — or from the pajama bottoms down — it's harder than ever to foster connection, joy, and well-being in our remote teams. All the while, behavioral science suggests that creating a company culture of humor and levity is the quickest path to nurturing these things.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>To answer your second question: Yes. Just roll with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This program is designed for individuals who want to be more energized, joyful, and effective at work and for remote teams that want to feel more connected, creative, and resilient through the most challenging times. It’s also for anyone who wants fewer one-hour meetings that feel like three-hour meetings with only ten minutes of useful work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You shouldn’t have to choose between catching up on your favorite comedy show and learning techniques for being happier and better at your job.

How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally?</p>\n<p>This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change.</p>\n<p>We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights. These rights have been challenged and expanded in significant Supreme Court cases, which will help to illustrate how historically disadvantaged groups have struggled to realize the 14th Amendment's promise of equality.</p>",
