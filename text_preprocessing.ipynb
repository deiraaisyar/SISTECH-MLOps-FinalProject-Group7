But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.\n\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself--the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.\nWhat's more, \"The Science of Happiness\" offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.\nThe course's co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They'll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude--experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.\nConsider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track.

         "How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?\nRemote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.\nRemote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.\nIn Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.\nRemote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere. Praise for the book includes:\n\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives. Few of us are going back to the way we worked. Read her book and begin to prepare for the other side of this pandemic now.\" - Larry Culp, CEO of GE\n\"I often talk about the importance of trust when it comes to work: the trust of your employees, and building trust with your customers. This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment.\" - Eric S. Yuan, Founder & CEO, Zoom",

This course is targeted at those people who have ambitions in Data Analytics or Data Scientist roles, as well as those who just have a need to use Excel to perform data analysis in their own company or environment.\nLearners will gain useful experience in the cleaning and wrangling of data using functions, and in analyzing data using methods such as sorting, filtering, and pivot tables. This course starts with an introduction to spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and discusses importing data from multiple different formats. During this introduction you will learn to carry out some basic-level data wrangling and data cleaning tasks and then you will expand your knowledge of data analysis via the use of sorting, filtering, and pivot tables in a spreadsheet.\nThe emphasis is on applied learning and hands-on practice in this course, and with each hands-on lab, you will gain further experience in the manipulation and handling of data and start to understand the important role that spreadsheets can perform in a data analysis environment. The final assignment project will allow you to apply these newly acquired skills to analyze data in a business scenario. By the end of this course, you will have worked with several data sets and spreadsheets and demonstrated the basics of cleaning and analyzing data all without having to learn any code.\nThis course makes it simple to get started using Excel for data analysis, as it does not require any previous spreadsheet or code-writing experience. The course also does not require you to perform any software downloads or installations. All that is required is a device with a modern web browser, and the ability to use (or create) a Microsoft account to access Excel online at no-cost. Although the hands-on labs steps are specifically related to using ‘Excel for the web’, if you already have the full desktop version of Excel, you should be able to use that to follow along quite easily with the labs.",

         "Modern systems today must be designed for agility in order to outpace the competition. Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.\nModern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.\nAgile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.\nData science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.\nWe’ll teach you the paradigms, processes, and introduce some key technologies that make the data-driven product organization the optimal competitor in the market.",

Though some of those issues have been addressed, substantial barriers—gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws—still restrain the power of the vote. Why? How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally?\nThis course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change.\nWe will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights. These rights have been challenged and expanded in significant Supreme Court cases, which will help to illustrate how historically disadvantaged groups have struggled to realize the 14th Amendment's promise of equality.",

But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life -- agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.\nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.\nThe course's instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.",

From a decision-making standpoint, it’s easy for the brain to process this decision tree. But, what happens when you’re faced with more complex, multifaceted decisions? You might make a comprehensive pro/con list, rank ordering the most important considerations. But, that can take endless amounts of time that you might not have to spare. When parsing through thousands or millions of data points, you and your organization need to tap into a more sophisticated approach. \nThe solution? Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning to enhance your decision-making processes. Machine learning with Python can not only help organize data, but machines can also be taught to analyze and learn from disparate data sets – forming hypotheses, creating predictions, and improving decisions.\nIn Machine Learning and AI with Python, you will explore the most basic algorithm as a basis for your learning and understanding of machine learning: decision trees. Developing your core skills in machine learning will create the foundation for expanding your knowledge into bagging and random forests, and from there into more complex algorithms like gradient boosting. \nUsing real-world cases and sample data sets, you will examine processes, chart your expectations, review the results, and measure the effectiveness of the machine’s techniques.\nThroughout the course, you will witness the evolution of the machine learning models, incorporating additional data and criteria – testing your predictions and analyzing the results along the way to avoid overtraining your data, mitigating overfitting and preventing biased outcomes.\nPut your data to work through machine learning with Python.",

         "Life is full of arguments—you encounter them everyday in your social and professional circles. From casually discussing what to have for dinner tonight with your family to passionately debating the best candidate to vote for in the upcoming election, arguments are a method to better educate ourselves and understand others.\n\n\nAll arguments share an underlying mapping structure that backs a main claim with supporting reasons, sometimes including counterpoints to anticipated objections. In order to present an argument that will clearly communicate your perspective, you must first understand the basic structure of any argument and develop your logic and critical thinking skills.\n\n\nIn Structure and Function of Argument: Introduction to Critical Thinking, you will engage in dynamic practice exercises to develop the ability to recognize, analyze, and construct arguments you encounter on a daily basis. You will consider the structure of an argument, focusing on the underlying organization of claims and reasoning. You will determine if the reasons support the author or speaker’s main claim, build well-constructed responses, and grow your overall English language skills. You will also test your listening skills by recognizing how things like logical fallacies, conflicting points of view, and controversial subjects can impact effective communication.\n\n\nUsing a tool called “argument mapping,” you will visually diagram the structure of an argument to identify how reasons connect and function in an argument. You will then apply your learnings and test your own arguments using this tool – allowing you to gauge the overall quality of your arguments and take steps to make them stronger.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have built a toolkit to engage in more constructive conversations and to actively listen to better understand others’ points of view.",

         "Architecture engages a culture’s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. This course will teach you how to understand architecture as both cultural expression and technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings, and hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, will bring you closer to the work of architects and historians.\nThe first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination. Perspective drawing and architectural typology are explored and you will be introduced to some of the challenges in writing architectural history.\nThen we address technology as a component of architecture. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. Technological advances changed what could be built, and even what could even be thought of as architecture.\nFinally, we'll confront architecture’s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. You will learn about architecture’s power of representation and see how it can produce collective meaning and memory.\nArchitecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Join us as we examine how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture’s complex aspirations.\nThis course is eligible for American Institute of Architects (AIA) continuing education units (CEUs).
