But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.</p>\n<p>\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself--the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.</p>\n<p>What's more, \"The Science of Happiness\" offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.</p>\n<p>The course's co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They'll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude--experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.</p>\n<p>Consider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track.

         "<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team.</p>",
         "<ul>\n<li>Understand the key elements of remote work and use your knowledge to successfully navigate the remote work environment </li>\n<li>Develop strategies for yourself and your team, improving productivity, communication, and collaboration</li>\n<li>Understand the types of trust required to be successful in remote working environments—and how to build it</li>\n<li>Learn how to select the right digital tools to increase productivity and access to team members</li>\n<li>Implement practices that will allow you to be an effective leader and successfully manage a remote team</li>\n<li>Create a plan to relaunch your team into successful remotely working contributors</li>\n</ul>",
         "<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>\n<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>\n<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>\n<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>\n<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>\n<p><em>\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives.

And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>\r\n<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point.

And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls.

In this brave new world of work, when we rarely see our team members in person — or from the pajama bottoms down — it's harder than ever to foster connection, joy, and well-being in our remote teams.

No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac. </p>\n<p>Whereas <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x\">CS50x</a> itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!</p>",
